Relevant and informative research in clinical development is often sophisticated and complex. Although the [chemical space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_space) too large to systematically test every molecule of potential interest [@hoffmann2019next], it is still feasible to use heuristics and [defeasible reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeasible_reasoning) to infer a [rank odering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hit_to_lead) from most to least promising molecules for further [development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preclinical_development) as potential investigational products. Given the extent to which the [search space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasible_region) for new [investigation products](https://ichgcp.net/46-investigational-products/) is uncharted, it seems as if all the [low hanging fruits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias) may have already been taken.
