The conceptualization of the institutional and economic structure of clinical development of investigational products are challenging to fully grasp. Research ethics is often focused on particular research such as an individual clinical study. In recent times, there is increasing interest in meta-research perspectives to foster ethical organization and oversight of clinical development. On this page, I summarize some of my readings in an unsystematic and eclectic way. The aim is not necessarily to say something entirely new or original, but perhaps someone who finds the way to this place will also find a value in the information discussed. Open peer-review is enabled using hypothes.is. This facilitates sentence-by-sentence annotation from readers directly on this page. "]
