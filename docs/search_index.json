To understand the complexity of clinical development gives rise to a garden of forking paths. Garden of a forking path: Please always refer directly to the original source (Kale, Kay, and Hullman 2019). As a result, also the conceptualization of the structure and mechanisms at play are challenging to fully understand. Even if starting the journey together, it is highly unlikely that any two people arrive at the same place at the end of the journey. On this page, I summarize some of my readings in an unsystematic and eclectic way. The aim is not necessarily to say something entirely new or original, but perhaps someone who finds the way to this place may also find some value in the information being discussed. Open peer-review is enabled using hypothes.is. This facilitates sentence-by-sentence annotation from readers directly on this page. References "]
