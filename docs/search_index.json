If you have any idea or suggestion, please leave a comment using the annotation function on this website. In a Stream Graph (Byron and Wattenberg 2008), the volume of individual streams is proportional to the values in each category (i.e. number of approvals per year). This plot might be useful to quickly assess “trends” in approval rate per therapeutic area over time. For instance, if you hover over the graph, you will quickly discover that there were quite disproportionately many approvals for Arthritis lately. Shown are therapeutic indications mentioned in EPARS (Papathanasiou et al. 2016). Data freeze: 25. November 2019. 1.1 Approvals per therapeutic area If you are more interested in “exact numbers, then here is a donut plot of the same data with a focus on the most active therapeutic areas. Note, however that the”therapeutic areas\" are not necessarily on the same level of abstraction in disease ontology. All data comes with absolutely no warranty. 1.2 Past regulatory applications With increasing experience on CTAs or INDs, there may be associations between “success” metrics and certain formal characteristics of application materials. According to BfArM there are 3,647 CTA application for 2014-2018 in Germany and according to EMA there are 132,700 CTA applications submitted to the EudraCT database in total. Unfortunately, as Wong, Siah, and Lo (2019) have demonstrated that the estimation of “success rate” is not without sophisticated complexities. The most dramatic barrier is that the actual data is behind paywalls, which severely limits research ethicists like me who suffer from scarce resources and high academic pressure to produce findings that “sell”.

["index.html", "Translational Research as a learning system Preface", " Translational Research as a learning system Merlin Bittlinger 2019-11-30 Preface Translational Research is a highly competitive and goal-oriented field. Metrics to evaluate “translational success”, such as Time-To-Market, Likelihood of Approval (Hay et al. 2014) or Probability of Success (Wong, Siah, and Lo 2019) provide incentive structures that function as the rules of the game. As such, the choice of metric determines what learning goal may or may not be achieved by optimizing the “success” rate of Translational Research. While economic perspectives on success metrics are important to understand Translational Research, they are limited in many respects. Clinical development is different from other business models as it critically depends on voluntary or even altruistic (Jansen 2009) research participation and hence on public trust. “Information gain per unit of accepted research burdens” is a patient-oriented concept introduced to further think about how the current regulatory oversight system learns from past clinical R&amp;D efforts. This may serve as a starting point to think about Translational Research as a Learning System (work in progress). The conceptualization of the scientific, institutional and economic structure of Translational Research needs to satisfy complex constraints and is challenging to fully grasp. Research ethics is often focused on particular research such as an individual clinical study. In recent times, there is increasing interest in meta-research perspectives to foster ethical organization and oversight of clinical development. On this page, I summarize some of my readings in an unsystematic and eclectic way. The aim is not necessarily to say something entirely new or original, but perhaps someone who finds the way to this place will also find a value in the information discussed here. Open peer-review is enabled using hypothes.is. This facilitates sentence-by-sentence annotation from readers directly on this page. Please feel free to annotate. Both constructive and destructive criticism is highly welcome. "]
