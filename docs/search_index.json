["translation.html", "Chapter 2 Translation", " Chapter 2 Translation Relevant and informative research in clinical development is often sophisticated and complex. Although the chemical space too large is to systematically test every molecule of potential interest (Hoffmann and Gastreich 2019), it is still feasible to use heuristics and defeasible reasoning to infer a rank oder from most to least promising molecules for further development as potential investigational products. Given the extent to which the search space for new investigational products is uncharted, it seems as if all the low hanging fruits may have already been taken.
