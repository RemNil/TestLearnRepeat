# Preface {-}
Metrics to evaluate "translational success" in clinical research provide general incentive structures that determine what learning goal may or may not be achieved by optimizing the success rate of Translational Research. "Information gain per capita of accepted research burdens" is a concept introduced to further think about how the current regulatory oversight system learns from past [clinical R&D efforts](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development) (work in progress).
