# Preface {-}

Metrics to evaluate "translational success" in clinical research provide general incentive structures that determine what learning goal may or may not be achieved by optimizing the success rate of Translational Research. "Information gain per capita of accepted research burdens" is a concept introduced to further think about how the current regulatory oversight system learns from past [clinical R&D efforts](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development) (work in progress). 

To understand the complexity of clinical development gives rise to a [garden of forking paths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzdqy7WR3Fg).

![Garden of a forking path: Please always refer directly to the [original source](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/files/2019-AnalysisPathsResearchSynthesis-CHI.pdf) [@alex2019decision].](https://mucollective.northwestern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gfp-image.png)

As a result, the  conceptualization of the structure, institutional and economic mechanisms at play are challenging to fully grasp. On this page, I summarize some of my readings in an unsystematic and eclectic way. The aim is not necessarily to say something entirely new or original, but perhaps someone who finds the way to this place will also find a value in the information discussed.

[Open peer-review](http://www.openreviewtoolkit.org/) is enabled using [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/). This facilitates sentence-by-sentence annotation from readers directly on this page.
