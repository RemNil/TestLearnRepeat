# Preface {-}
Metrics to evaluate "translational sucess" in clinical resarch provide general incentive structures that determine what learning goal may or may not be achieved by optimizing the success rate of Translational Research. "Information gain per (capita) accepted research burden" is a concept introduced by Bittlinger et al. (in preperation) to think about how the current regulatory oversigth system learns from past [clinical R&D efforts](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development) (work in progess).
