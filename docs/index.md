# Preface {-}
Translational Research is a highly competitive field. Metrics to evaluate "translational success" provide  [incentive structures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incentive) that function as the rules of the game. As such, the choice of metric determines what learning goal may or may not be achieved by optimizing the "success" rate of Translational Research. ["Information gain per unit a of accepted research burdens"](https://soundcloud.com/plenarysession/ep223) is a concept introduced to further think about how the current regulatory oversight system learns from past [clinical R&D efforts](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-development). This may serve as a starting point to think about [Translational Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_research) as a [Learning System](https://remnil.github.io/TestLearnRepeat/learning.html) (work in progress).

The conceptualization of the [scientific](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92015/), [institutional](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_6ear-yORE) and economic structure of [Translational Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translational_research) needs to satisfy [complex constraints](https://sistemas.colmex.mx/Reportes/LACEALAMES/LACEA-LAMES2019_paper_106.pdf) and is challenging to fully grasp. [Research ethics](https://cioms.ch/shop/product/international-ethical-guidelines-for-health-related-research-involving-humans/) is often focused on particular research such as an individual clinical study. In recent times, there is increasing interest in meta-research perspectives to foster ethical organization and oversight of clinical development. 


On this page, I summarize some of my readings in an unsystematic and eclectic way. The aim is not necessarily to say something entirely new or original, but perhaps someone who finds the way to this place will also find a value in the information discussed.

[Open peer-review](http://www.openreviewtoolkit.org/) is enabled using [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/). This facilitates sentence-by-sentence annotation from readers directly on this page.
