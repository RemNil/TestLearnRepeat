Submission, including registration, takes place as part of the [CTA process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WANVbEgHH8) and will need to include:

- Main characteristics of the trial
- Subject information sheet/Informed Consent Form (ICF)
- Protocol
- Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier(IMPD) (Safety and Efficacy only)
- [Investigator Brochure (IB)]()
- Regulator requests and assessment reports
- Sponsor responses


## Past regulatory applications
With increasing experience on [CTAs](https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/help/Default.htm#eudract/purpose_cta_ov.htm) or [INDs](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application), there may be associations between "success" metrics and certain formal characteristics of application materials. According to [BfArM](https://www.bfarm.de/EN/BfArM/_node.html) there are 3,647 applicatioin for 2014-2018,

### Limitations
This kind of data is from [grey literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature). Although the data is scraped from the web, it can be seen as an "official" release by federal institutions. However, no [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) is available and the scope and breadth of the data is very limited which severely hampers knowledge from past experience.

“Information gain per capita of accepted research burdens” is an useful concept.
