# Learning

Depending on the [regulatory pathway](https://collaboration.fda.gov/pqigjg5xl6jx/?proto=true), there are several decision points during clinical development that can be used as ["hard" endpoints](https://www.eupati.eu/glossary/hard-endpoint/) to measure "success" by well defined and objective criteria:

(1) Investigational New Drug [(IND)](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application) application or Clinical Trial Application (CTA) granted (yes/no)?  
(3) Market Authorisation granted (yes/no)?  

However, on closer inspection, the criteria to determine (1) and (2) are consdierably "soft" and involve less well-defined terms and subjective judgments such as "substantial evidence" or the ratio of expected benefit and risks. An important task for research ethics is to frame the question of *what determines "translational success"?* in such a way that we devise a metric that is measurable and guarantees that Translational Research froms a learning system that converges towards an optimal trade-off between research-burden-accepte [@lingler2014new, @phillips2019analysis] and information gain [@ioannidis2016most].

Submission, including registration, takes place as part of the [CTA process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9WANVbEgHH8) and will need to include:

- Main characteristics of the trial
- Subject information sheet/Informed Consent Form (ICF)
- Protocol
- Investigational Medicinal Product Dossier(IMPD) (Safety and Efficacy only)
- [Investigator Brochure (IB)]()
- Regulator requests and assessment reports
- Sponsor responses


## Past regulatory applications
With increasing experience on [CTAs](https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/help/Default.htm#eudract/purpose_cta_ov.htm) or [INDs](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/types-applications/investigational-new-drug-ind-application), there may be associations between "success" metrics and certain formal characteristics of application materials. According to [BfArM](https://www.bfarm.de/EN/BfArM/_node.html) there are 3,647 CTA applicatioin for 2014-2018 in Germany and according to EMA there are [132,700 CTA applications](https://eudract.ema.europa.eu/docs/statistics/EudraCT_Statistics_2019/EudraCT_Public_Report_Stats_Oct_2019.pdf) submitted to the EudraCT database in total.

### Limitations
This kind of data is from [grey literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature). Although the data is scraped from the web, it can be seen as an "official" release by federal institutions. However, no [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) is available and the scope and breadth of the data is very limited which severely hampers knowledge from past experience.

“Information gain per capita of accepted research burdens” is an useful concept.
