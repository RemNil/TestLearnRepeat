# Learning


## Why learn at all?
With increasing experience on CTAs or INDs, there may be associations between "success" metrics and certain formal characteristics of application materials. According to [BfArM](https://www.bfarm.de/EN/BfArM/_node.html) there are 3,647 applicatioin for 2014-2018,

### Limitations
This kind of data is from [grey literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_literature). Although the data is scraped from the web, it can be seen as an "official" release by federal institutions. However, no [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) is available and the scope and breadth of the data is very limited which severely hampers knowledge from past experience.

## What to learn first?
“Information gain per capita of accepted research burdens” is an useful concept.
