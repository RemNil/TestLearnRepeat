   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: Patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants benefit highly from MRI, however, access to MRI is restricted for these patients because of safety hazards associated with RF heating of the implant. To date, all MRI studies on RF heating of medical implants have been performed in horizontal closed-bore systems. Vertical MRI scanners have a fundamentally different distribution of electric and magnetic fields and are now available at 1.2T, capable of high-resolution structural and functional MRI. This work presents the first simulation study of RF heating of DBS implants in high-field vertical scanners.METHODS: We performed finite element electromagnetic simulations to calculate specific absorption rate (SAR) at tips of DBS leads during MRI in a commercially available 1.2T vertical coil compared to a 1.5T horizontal scanner. Both isolated leads and fully implanted systems were included.RESULTS: We found 10- to 30-fold reduction in SAR implication at tips of isolated DBS leads, and up to 19-fold SAR reduction at tips of leads in fully implanted systems in vertical coils compared to horizontal birdcage coils.CONCLUSIONS: If confirmed in larger patient cohorts and verified experimentally, this result can open the door to plethora of structural and functional MRI applications to guide, interpret, and advance DBS therapy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: ‎Neuromodulation modalities are used as effective treatments for some brain disorders‎. ‎Non-invasive‎ ‌‎deep brain stimulation (NDBS) via temporally interfering electric fields has emerged recently as a non-invasive strategy for electrically stimulating deep regions in the brain‎. The objective of this study is to provide insight into the fundamental mechanisms of this strategy and assess the potential uses of this method through computational analysis. Approach‎. ‎Analytical and numerical methods are used to compute the electric potential and field distributions generated during NDBS in homogeneous and inhomogeneous models of the brain‎. ‎The computational results are used for specifying the activated area in the brain (macroscopic approach)‎, ‎and quantifying its relationships to the stimulation parameters‎. ‎Two automatic algorithms‎, ‎using artificial neural network (ANN)‎, ‎are developed for the homogeneous model with two and four electrode pairs to estimate stimulation parameters‎. ‎Additionally‎, ‎the extracellular potentials are coupled to the compartmental axon cable model to determine the responses of the neurons to the modulated electric field in two developed models and to evaluate the precise activated area location (microscopic approach)‎. Main results‎. ‎Our results show that although the shape of the activated area was different in macroscopic and microscopic approaches‎, ‎it located only at depth‎. ‎Our optimization algorithms showed significant accuracy in estimating stimulation parameters‎. ‎Moreover‎, ‎it demonstrated that the more the electrode pairs‎, ‎the more controllable the activated area‎. ‎Finally‎, ‎compartmental axon cable modeling results verified that neurons can demodulate and follow the electric field modulation envelope amplitude (MEA) in our models‎. ‎Significance‎. ‎The results of this study help develop the NDBS method and eliminate some limitations associated with the nonautomated optimization algorithm‎. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Accessibility of cortical regions to focal TES: Dependence on spatial position, safety, and practical constraints. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> S1053-8119(19)30774-8 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial electric stimulation (TES) can modulate intrinsic neural activity in the brain by injecting weak currents through electrodes attached to the scalp. TES has been widely used as a neuroscience tool to investigate how behavioural and physiological variables of brain function are modulated by electric stimulation of specific brain regions. For an unambiguous interpretation of TES experiments, it is important that the electric fields can be steered towards one or several brain regions-of-interest. However, the conductive proprieties of the human head impose inherent physical limitations on how focal the electric fields in the brain produced by multi-electrode TES can be. As a rule of thumb, it is not feasible to selectively target deep brain areas with TES, although focusing the field in some specific deeper locations might be possible due to favourable conductive properties in the surrounding tissue. In the present study, we first propose a computationally efficient method for the automatic determination of electrode placements and stimulation intensities to optimally affect a given target position. We provide a robust implementation of the optimization procedure that is able to adhere to safety constraints, while explicitly controlling both the number of active electrodes and the angular deviation of the field in the target area relative to the desired field direction. Leveraging the high computational efficiency of our method, we systematically assess the achievable focality of multi-electrode TES for all cortex positions, thereby investigating the dependence on the chosen constraints. Our results provide comprehensive insight into the limitations regarding the achievable TES dose and focality that are imposed by the biophysical constraints and the safety considerations of TES. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Prospects for transcranial temporal interference stimulation in humans: A computational study. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> S1053-8119(19)30715-3 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is a noninvasive method used to modulate activity of superficial brain regions. Deeper and more steerable stimulation could potentially be achieved using transcranial temporal interference stimulation (tTIS): two high-frequency alternating fields interact to produce a wave with an envelope frequency in the range thought to modulate neural activity. Promising initial results have been reported for experiments with mice. In this study we aim to better understand the electric fields produced with tTIS and examine its prospects in humans through simulations with murine and human head models. A murine head finite element model was used to simulate previously published experiments of tTIS in mice. With a total current of 0.776 mA, tTIS electric field strengths up to 383 V/m were reached in the modeled mouse brain, affirming experimental results indicating that suprathreshold stimulation is possible in mice. Using a detailed anisotropic human head model, tTIS was simulated with systematically varied electrode configurations and input currents to investigate how these parameters influence the electric fields. An exhaustive search with 88 electrode locations covering the entire head (146M current patterns) was employed to optimize tTIS for target field strength and focality. In all analyses, we investigated maximal effects and effects along the predominant orientation of local neurons. Our results showed that it was possible to steer the peak tTIS field by manipulating the relative strength of the two input fields. Deep brain areas received field strengths similar to conventional tACS, but with less stimulation in superficial areas. Maximum field strengths in the human model were much lower than in the murine model, too low to expect direct stimulation effects. While field strengths from tACS were slightly higher, our results suggest that tTIS is capable of producing more focal fields and allows for better steerability. Finally, we present optimal four-electrode current patterns to maximize tTIS in regions of the pallidum (0.37 V/m), hippocampus (0.24 V/m) and motor cortex (0.57 V/m). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Non-invasive brain tissue stimulation with a magnetic coil provides several irreplaceable advantages over that with an implanted electrode, in altering neural activities under pathological situations. We reviewed clinical cases that utilized time-varying magnetic fields for the treatment of epilepsy, and the safety issues related to this practice. Animal models have been developed to foster understanding of the cellular/molecular mechanisms underlying magnetic control of epileptic activity. These mechanisms include (but are not limited to) (1) direct membrane polarization by the magnetic field, (2) depolarization blockade by the deactivation of ion channels, (3) alteration in synaptic transmission, and (4) interruption of ephaptic interaction and cellular synchronization. Clinical translation of this technology could be improved through the advancement of magnetic design, optimization of stimulation protocols, and evaluation of the long-term safety. Cellular and molecular studies focusing on the mechanisms of magnetic stimulation are of great value in facilitating this translation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Conventional deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems with ring-shaped leads generate spherical electrical fields. In contrast, novel directional leads use segmented electrodes. Aim of this study was to quantify the impedance variations over time in subjects with the directional Cartesia-Boston® system.METHODS: Impedance records, programming settings, and clinical data of 11 consecutive Parkinsonian patients implanted with DBS directional leads in two Italian centers (Udine and Vicenza) were retrospectively evaluated. Data were collected before starting stimulation (in the operating room and at days 5 and 40) and after switching stimulation on at the successive follow-up visits (1, 6 and 12 months).RESULTS: Directional leads have significantly higher impedance than ring leads. Stimulated contacts had always lower impedance compared to non-stimulated contacts. Before DBS-on, all contacts had higher impedance in the operating room, with an initial decrease five days post-surgery and a subsequent increase at day 40, more evident for directional contacts. The impedance of directional leads increased post-implantation at 1 and 6 months with a plateau at 12 months.CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant difference between the directional and ring leads at baseline (before activation of DBS) and during follow-up (chronic DBS).SIGNIFICANCE: Our study reveals new information about the impedance of segmented electrodes that is useful for patient management during the initial test period, as well as during long-term DBS follow-up. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S0924-977X(19)30267-6 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> High-frequency repeated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) has received FDA clearance for both the figure-of-8 coil (figure-8 coil) and the H1 coil. The FDA-cleared MDD protocols for both coils include high frequency (10-18 Hz) stimulation targeting the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) at an intensity that is 120% of the right-hand resting motor threshold. Despite these similar parameters, the two coils generate distinct electrical fields (e-fields) which result in differences in the cortical stimulation they produce. Due to the differences in coil designs, the H1 coil induces a stimulation e-field that is broader and deeper than the one induced by the figure-8 coil. In this paper we review theoretical and clinical implications of these differences between the two coils and compare evidence of their safety and efficacy in treating MDD. We present the design principles of the coils, the challenges of identifying, finding, and stimulating the optimal brain target of each individual (both from functional and connectivity perspectives), and the possible implication of stimulating outside that target. There is only one study that performed a direct comparison between clinical effectiveness of the two coils, using the standard FDA-approved protocols in MDD patients. This study indicated clinical superiority of the H1 coil but did not measure long-term effects. Post-marketing data suggest that both coils have a similar safety profile in clinical practice, whereas effect size comparisons of the two respective FDA pivotal trials suggests that the H1 coil may have an advantage in efficacy. We conclude that further head-to-head experiments are needed, especially ones that will compare long-term effects and usage of similar temporal stimulation parameters and similar number of pulses. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) plays an important role in treatment of mental and neurological illnesses, and neurosurgery. However, it is difficult to target specific brain regions accurately because the complex anatomy of the brain substantially affects the shape and strength of the electric fields induced by the TMS coil. A volume conductor model can be used for determining the accurate electric fields; however, the construction of subject-specific anatomical head structures is time-consuming.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to propose a method to estimate electric fields induced by TMS from only T1 magnetic resonance (MR) images, without constructing a subject-specific anatomical model.METHODS: Very large sets of electric fields in the brain of subject-specific anatomical models, which are constructed from T1 and T2 MR images, are computed by a volume conductor model. The relation between electric field distribution and T1 MR images is used for machine learning. Deep neural network (DNN) models are applied for the first time to electric field estimation.RESULTS: By determining the relationships between the T1 MR images and electric fields by DNN models, the process of electric field estimation is markedly accelerated (to 0.03 s) due to the absence of a requirement for anatomical head structure reconstruction and volume conductor computation. Validation shows promising estimation accuracy, and rapid computations of the DNN model are apt for practical applications.CONCLUSION: The study showed that the DNN model can estimate the electric fields from only T1 MR images and requires low computation time, suggesting the possibility of using machine learning for real-time electric field estimation in navigated TMS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S1053-8119(19)30476-8 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established and effective treatment for several movement disorders and is being developed to treat a host of neuropsychiatric disorders including epilepsy, chronic pain, obsessive compulsive disorder, and depression. However, the neural mechanisms through which DBS produces therapeutic benefits, and in some cases unwanted side effects, in these disorders are only partially understood. Non-invasive neuroimaging techniques that can assess the neural effects of active stimulation are important for advancing our understanding of the neural basis of DBS therapy. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a safe, passive imaging modality with relatively high spatiotemporal resolution, which makes it a potentially powerful method for examining the cortical network effects of DBS. However, the degree to which magnetic artifacts produced by stimulation and the associated hardware can be suppressed from MEG data, and the comparability between signals measured during DBS-on and DBS-off conditions, have not been fully quantified. The present study used machine learning methods in conjunction with a visual perception task, which should be relatively unaffected by DBS, to quantify how well neural data can be salvaged from artifact contamination introduced by DBS and how comparable DBS-on and DBS-off data are after artifact removal. Machine learning also allowed us to determine whether the spatiotemporal pattern of neural activity recorded during stimulation are comparable to those recorded when stimulation is off. The spatiotemporal patterns of visually evoked neural fields could be accurately classified in all 8 patients with DBS implants during both DBS-on and DBS-off conditions and performed comparably across those two conditions. Further, the classification accuracy for classifiers trained on the spatiotemporal patterns evoked during DBS-on trials and applied to DBS-off trials, and vice versa, were similar to that of the classifiers trained and tested on either trial type, demonstrating the comparability of these patterns across conditions. Together, these results demonstrate the ability of MEG preprocessing techniques, like temporal signal space separation, to salvage neural data from recordings contaminated with DBS artifacts and validate MEG as a powerful tool to study the cortical consequences of DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S1053-8119(19)30398-2 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Patients with deep brain stimulation devices highly benefit from postoperative MRI exams, however MRI is not readily accessible to these patients due to safety risks associated with RF heating of the implants. Recently we introduced a patient-adjustable reconfigurable coil technology that substantially reduced local SAR at tips of single isolated DBS leads during MRI at 1.5 T in 9 realistic patient models. This contribution extends our work to higher fields by demonstrating the feasibility of scaling the technology to 3T and assessing its performance in patients with bilateral leads as well as fully implanted systems. We developed patient-derived models of bilateral DBS leads and fully implanted DBS systems from postoperative CT images of 13 patients and performed finite element simulations to calculate SAR amplification at electrode contacts during MRI with a reconfigurable rotating coil at 3T. Compared to a conventional quadrature body coil, the reconfigurable coil system reduced the SAR on average by 83% for unilateral leads and by 59% for bilateral leads. A simple surgical modification in trajectory of implanted leads was demonstrated to increase the SAR reduction efficiency of the rotating coil to &amp;gt;90% in a patient with a fully implanted bilateral DBS system. Thermal analysis of temperature-rise around electrode contacts during typical brain exams showed a 15-fold heating reduction using the rotating coil, generating &amp;lt;1°C temperature rise during ∼4-min imaging with high-SAR sequences where a conventional CP coil generated &amp;gt;10°C temperature rise in the tissue for the same flip angle. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S0006-8993(19)30169-6 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Following its success in the treatment of refractory movement disorders, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently under clinical investigation as a possible treatment for several neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). DBS's mechanism of action, delivery regimen, optimal brain target, and timeline of behavioural and neuroanatomical outcomes are all open fields of investigation. There is a critical need to develop methodologies that allow us to examine the time course of both behavioural changes and neuroanatomical remodelling in response to DBS. Here we present a proof-of-concept methodology for DBS experiments which incorporates both brain imaging and behaviour in a longitudinal fashion. We implanted triple transgenic AD mouse models (expressing mutations for both amyloid and tau) with custom magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible, carbon based electrodes. Mice received DBS or sham stimulation to the fornix (a critical white matter node in the brain's memory circuit) for 1 h (100 Hz, 100 μs pulses, 100 μA). Treatment was followed with an adapted Morris water maze (to test learning and memory; performed weekly) and structural MRI (to assess neuroanatomy; 3 days before and 3 days after DBS with a 6 week follow-up). The acute DBS treatment improved learning and long term memory in a delayed, sex specific, and transient manner relative to sham-stimulated controls. Significant, persistent, volumetric changes were seen in diverse brains structures, also heavily mediated by sex. We believe this methodology may be used as a template for DBS-related experimentation and will encourage preclinical studies to use longitudinal designs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S0301-0082(18)30060-1 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The field of neuromodulation is developing rapidly. Current techniques, however, are still limited as they i) either depend on permanent implants, ii) require invasive procedures, iii) are not cell-type specific, iv) involve slow pharmacokinetics or v) have a restricted penetration depth making it difficult to stimulate regions deep within the brain. Refinements into the different fields of neuromodulation are thus needed. In this review, we will provide background information on the different techniques of neuromodulation discussing their latest refinements and future potentials including the implementation of nanoparticles (NPs). In particular we will highlight the usage of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as transducers in advanced neuromodulation. When exposed to an alternating magnetic field (AMF), certain MNPs can generate heat through hysteresis. This MNP heating has been promising in the field of cancer therapy and has recently been introduced as a method for remote and wireless neuromodulation. This indicates that MNPs may aid in the exploration of brain functions via neuromodulation and may eventually be applied for treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We will address the materials chemistry of MNPs, their biomedical applications, their delivery into the brain, their mechanisms of stimulation with emphasis on MNP heating and their remote control in living tissue. The final section compares and discusses the parameters used for MNP heating in brain cancer treatment and neuromodulation. Concluding, using MNPs for nanomaterial-mediated neuromodulation seem promising in a variety of techniques and could be applied for different neuropsychiatric disorders when more extensively investigated. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1093/ons/opz018 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a treatment modality increasingly utilized in the management of neurological and psychiatric conditions. Neurosurgical technical considerations and contraindications have yet to be thoroughly characterized in the literature. The patient population for DBS includes many elderly patients with multiple comorbidities who require treatments and investigations that expose them to electromagnetic fields of varying strengths and durations, including other implanted electromodulatory devices.OBJECTIVE: To determine if clinically significant interference arises between DBS and cardiac pacemaker systems.METHODS: Here we audited 8 patients, mean age 72, with cardiac pacemakers and DBS implanted from 2007 to 2015. We investigated details of their neurological and electrocardiological treatment and progress and sought evidence for interference between the two systems.RESULTS: We found no evidence of DBS dysfunction, and only one case of abnormal pacemaker interrogation 2 yr post-DBS implantation was found, which was thought to be secondary to a medication issue rather than neuromodulation interference.CONCLUSION: Our research reassures the clinician that pacemakers and DBS systems do not appear to affect one another and provides guidance on minimizing possibility of this. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial alternating current stimulation entrains single-neuron activity in the primate brain. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1073/pnas.1815958116 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Spike timing is thought to play a critical role in neural computation and communication. Methods for adjusting spike timing are therefore of great interest to researchers and clinicians alike. Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) is a noninvasive technique that uses weak electric fields to manipulate brain activity. Early results have suggested that this technique can improve subjects' behavioral performance on a wide range of tasks and ameliorate some clinical conditions. Nevertheless, considerable skepticism remains about its efficacy, especially because the electric fields reaching the brain during tES are small, whereas the likelihood of indirect effects is large. Our understanding of its effects in humans is largely based on extrapolations from simple model systems and indirect measures of neural activity. As a result, fundamental questions remain about whether and how tES can influence neuronal activity in the human brain. Here, we demonstrate that tES, as typically applied to humans, affects the firing patterns of individual neurons in alert nonhuman primates, which are the best available animal model for the human brain. Specifically, tES consistently influences the timing, but not the rate, of spiking activity within the targeted brain region. Such effects are frequency- and location-specific and can reach deep brain structures; control experiments show that they cannot be explained by sensory stimulation or other indirect influences. These data thus provide a strong mechanistic rationale for the use of tES in humans and will help guide the development of future tES applications. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The auditory pathway consists of multiple stages, from the cochlear nucleus to the auditory cortex. Neurons acting at different stages have different functions and exhibit different response properties. It is unclear whether these stages share a common encoding mechanism. We trained an unsupervised deep learning model consisting of alternating sparse coding and max pooling layers on cochleogram-filtered human speech. Evaluation of the response properties revealed that computing units in lower layers exhibited spectro-temporal receptive fields (STRFs) similar to those of inferior colliculus neurons measured in physiological experiments, including properties such as sound onset and termination, checkerboard pattern, and spectral motion. Units in upper layers tended to be tuned to phonetic features such as plosivity and nasality, resembling the results of field recording in human auditory cortex. Variation of the sparseness level of the units in each higher layer revealed a positive correlation between the sparseness level and the strength of phonetic feature encoding. The activities of the units in the top layer, but not other layers, correlated with the dynamics of the first two formants (F1, F2) of all phonemes, indicating the encoding of phoneme dynamics in these units. These results suggest that the principles of sparse coding and max pooling may be universal in the human auditory pathway. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> We design, develop, and disseminate a 'virtual population' of five realistic computational models of deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients for electromagnetic (EM) analysis. We found five DBS patients in our institution' research patient database who received high quality post-DBS surgery computer tomography (CT) examinations of the head and neck. Three patients have a single implanted pulse generator (IPG) and the two others have two IPGs (one for each lead). Moreover, one patient has two abandoned leads on each side of the head. For each patient, we combined the head and neck volumes into a 'virtual CT', from which we extracted the full-length DBS path including the IPG, extension cables, and leads. We corrected topology errors in this path, such as self-intersections, using a previously published optimization procedure. We segmented the virtual CT volume into bones, internal air, and soft tissue classes and created two-manifold, watertight surface meshes of these distributions. In addition, we added a segmented model of the brain (grey matter, white matter, eyes and cerebrospinal fluid) to one of the model (nickname Freddie) that was derived from a T1-weighted MR image obtained prior to the DBS implantation. We simulated the EM fields and specific absorption rate (SAR) induced at 3 Tesla by a quadrature birdcage body coil in each of the five patient models using a co-simulation strategy. We found that inter-subject peak SAR variability across models was independent of the target averaging mass and equal to ~45%. In our simulations of the full brain segmentation and six simplified versions of the Freddie model, the error associated with incorrect dielectric property assignment around the DBS electrodes was greater than the error associated with modeling the whole model as a single tissue class. Our DBS patient models are freely available on our lab website (Webpage of the Martinos Center Phantom Resource 2018 https://phantoms.martinos.org/Main_Page). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indentation response in porcine brain under electric fields. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1039/c8sm01272e </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electric fields in the environment can have profound effects on brain function and behavior. In clinical practice, some noninvasive/microinvasive therapies with electrical fields such as transcranial electrical stimulation (tES), deep brain stimulation (DBS), and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) have emerged as powerful tools for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders and neuromodulation. Nonetheless, currently, most studies focus on the mechanisms and effects of therapies and do not to address the mechanical properties of brain tissue under electric fields. Thus, the mechanical behavior of brain tissue, which plays an important role in modulating both brain form and brain function, should be given attention. The present study addresses this paucity by presenting, for the first time, the mechanical properties of brain tissue under various intensities of direct current electric field (0, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 V) using a custom-designed indentation device. Prior to brain indentation, validation tests were performed in different hydrogels to ensure that there was no interference in the electric fields from the indentation device. Subsequently, the load trace data obtained from the indentation-relaxation tests was fitted to both linear elastic and viscoelastic models to characterize the sensitivity of the mechanical behavior of the brain tissue to the electric fields. The brain tissue was found to be softened at a higher electric field level and less viscous, and substantially responded more quickly with an increase in electric field. The explanations for the above behaviors were further discussed based on the analysis of the resistance and thermal responses during the testing process. Understanding the effect of electric fields on brain tissue at the mechanical level can provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of some therapies, which may be beneficial to guide therapy protocols. </td>

The second part of the review is focused on the deep stimulation of brain structures that can slow down memory loss in AD. The third part describes the results of the use of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques for memory modulation, consolidation, and retrieval in healthy people and animal models.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 9300504 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is one of the most widely used noninvasive brain stimulation method. It has been utilized for both treatment and diagnosis of many neural diseases, such as neuropathic pain and loss of function caused by stroke. Existing TMS tools cannot deliver focused electric field to targeted penetration depth even though many important neurological disorders are originated from there. A breakthrough is needed to achieve noninvasive, focused brain stimulation. We demonstrated using magnetic shield to achieve magnetic focusing without sacrificing significant amount of throughput. The shield is composed of multiple layers of copper ring arrays, which utilize induced current to generate counter magnetic fields. We experimentally set up a two-pole stimulator system to verify device simulation. A transient magnetic field probe was used for field measurements. The focusing effect highly depends on the geometric design of shield. A tight focal spot with a diameter of smaller than 5mm (plotted in Matlab contour map) can be achieved by using copper ring arrays. With properly designed array structures and rings locations, the combined original and induced counter fields can produce a tightly focused field distribution with enhanced field strength at a depth 7.5mm beyond the shield plane, which is sufficient to reach many deep and critical parts of a mouse brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1073/pnas.1800901115 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Children who are treated for congenital cataracts later exhibit impairments in configural face analysis. This has been explained in terms of a critical period for the acquisition of normal face processing. Here, we consider a more parsimonious account according to which deficits in configural analysis result from the abnormally high initial retinal acuity that children treated for cataracts experience, relative to typical newborns. According to this proposal, the initial period of low retinal acuity characteristic of normal visual development induces extended spatial processing in the cortex that is important for configural face judgments. As a computational test of this hypothesis, we examined the effects of training with high-resolution or blurred images, and staged combinations, on the receptive fields and performance of a convolutional neural network. The results show that commencing training with blurred images creates receptive fields that integrate information across larger image areas and leads to improved performance and better generalization across a range of resolutions. These findings offer an explanation for the observed face recognition impairments after late treatment of congenital blindness, suggest an adaptive function for the acuity trajectory in normal development, and provide a scheme for improving the performance of computational face recognition systems. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior thalamic complex (ANT) is an adjunctive therapy for pharmacoresistant epilepsy. To define the most efficient target in DBS for epilepsy, we investigate clinical data, position of leads, usability of atlas data compared to electric field modeling based on programming parameters.METHODS: Data from ten consecutive patients who underwent ANT-DBS were analyzed. The mammillothalamic tract (MTT), an internal landmark for direct stereotactic targeting, was segmented from MRI. Centers of stimulation were determined and their positions relative to ventricles and the MTT were analyzed. Two 3D thalamus atlases were transformed to segmented patient's thalami and proportions of activated nuclei were calculated.CONCLUSIONS: The distance of the active contact to the lateral wall of the third ventricle, MTT and the ventrodorsal distance to midcommissural plane appear to be relevant for optimal target planning. For reduction of focal seizure frequency, we found best response rates with a center of stimulation 5 mm lateral to the wall of the third ventricle, and a lead tip 10 mm dorsal of the midcommissural plane. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> S1053-8119(18)30819-X </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Access to MRI is limited for patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants due to safety hazards, including radiofrequency (RF) heating of tissue surrounding the leads. Computational models provide an exquisite tool to explore the multi-variate problem of RF heating and help better understand the interaction of electromagnetic fields and biological tissues. This paper presents a computational approach to assess RF-induced heating, in terms of specific absorption rate (SAR) in the tissue, around the tip of bilateral DBS leads during MRI at 64MHz/1.5 T and 127 MHz/3T. Patient-specific realistic lead models were constructed from post-operative CT images of nine patients operated for sub-thalamic nucleus DBS. Finite element method was applied to calculate the SAR at the tip of left and right DBS contact electrodes. Both transmit head coils and transmit body coils were analyzed. We found a substantial difference between the SAR and temperature rise at the tip of right and left DBS leads, with the lead contralateral to the implanted pulse generator (IPG) exhibiting up to 7 times higher SAR in simulations, and up to 10 times higher temperature rise during measurements. The orientation of incident electric field with respect to lead trajectories was explored and a metric to predict local SAR amplification was introduced. Modification of the lead trajectory was shown to substantially reduce the heating in phantom experiments using both conductive wires and commercially available DBS leads. Finally, the surgical feasibility of implementing the modified trajectories was demonstrated in a patient operated for bilateral DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Parkinsonian signs in patients with cervical dystonia treated with pallidal deep brain stimulation. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1093/brain/awy217 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Pallidal deep brain stimulation is an established treatment in patients with dystonia. However, evidence from case series or uncontrolled studies suggests that it may lead in some patients to specific parkinsonian symptoms such as freezing of gait, micrographia, and bradykinesia. We investigated parkinsonian signs using the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score by means of observer-blinded video ratings in a group of 29 patients treated with pallidal stimulation and a non-surgical control group of 22 patients, both with predominant cervical dystonia. Additional assessments included MRI-based models of volume of neural tissue activated to investigate areas of stimulation related to dystonic symptom control and those likely to induce parkinsonian signs as well as an EMG analysis to investigate functional vicinity of stimulation fields to the pyramidal tract. Compared with controls, stimulated patients had significantly higher motor scores (median, 25th-75th percentile: 14.0, 8.0-19.5 versus 3.0, 2.0-8.0; P &amp;lt; 0.0001), as well as bradykinesia (8.0, 6.0-14.0 versus 2.0, 0.0-3.0; P &amp;lt; 0.0001) and axial motor subscores (2.0, 1.0-4.0 versus 0.0, 0.0-1.0; P = 0.0002), while rigidity and tremor subscores were not different between groups. Parkinsonian signs were partially reversible upon switching stimulation off for a median of 90 min in a subset of 19 patients tolerating this condition. Furthermore, the stimulation group reported more features of freezing of gait on a questionnaire basis. Quality of life was better in stimulated patients compared with control patients, but parkinsonian signs were negatively associated with quality of life. In the descriptive imaging analysis maximum efficacy for dystonia improvement projected to the posteroventrolateral internal pallidum with overlapping clusters driving severity of bradykinesia and axial motor symptoms. The severities of parkinsonian signs were not correlated with functional vicinity to the pyramidal tract as assessed by EMG. In conclusion, parkinsonian signs, particularly bradykinesia and axial motor signs, due to pallidal stimulation in dystonic patients are frequent and negatively impact on motor functioning and quality of life. Therefore, patients with pallidal stimulation should be monitored closely for such signs both in clinical routine and future clinical trials. Spread of current outside the internal pallidum is an unlikely explanation for this phenomenon, which seems to be caused by stimulation of neural elements within the stimulation target volume. </td>

Orientation-selective pulse paradigms were evaluated in conceptual models and in patient-specific models of subthalamic nucleus (STN)-DBS for treating Parkinson's disease.Single-contact monopolar or two-contact bipolar stimulation through clinical DBS leads with cylindrical electrodes primarily activated axons orientated parallel to the lead. Conversely, multi-contact monopolar stimulation with a cathode-leading pulse waveform selectively activated axons perpendicular to the DBS lead. Clinical DBS leads with segmented rows of electrodes and a single current source provided additional angular resolution for activating axons oriented 0°, ±22.5°, ±45°, ±67.5°, or 90° relative to the lead shaft. Employing multiple independent current sources to deliver unequal amounts of current through these leads further increased the angular resolution of activation relative to the lead shaft. The patient-specific models indicated that multi-contact cathode configurations, which are rarely used in clinical practice, could increase activation of the hyperdirect pathway collaterals projecting into STN (a putative therapeutic target), while minimizing direct activation of the corticospinal tract of internal capsule, which can elicit sensorimotor side-effects when stimulated.&lt;/AbstractText&gt;: Single-contact monopolar or two-contact bipolar stimulation through clinical DBS leads with cylindrical electrodes primarily activated axons orientated parallel to the lead.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stimulation of deep brain structures by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a method for activating deep neurons in the brain and can be beneficial for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. To numerically investigate the possibility for deeper brain stimulation (electric fields reaching the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens, and the cerebellum), combined TMS coils using the double-cone coil with the Halo coil (HDA) were modeled and investigated. Numerical simulations were performed using MIDA: a new multimodal imaging-based detailed anatomical model of the human head and neck. The 3D distributions of magnetic flux density and electric field were calculated. The percentage of volume of each tissue that is exposed to electric field amplitude equal or greater than 50% of the maximum amplitude of E in the cortex for each coil was calculated to quantify the electric field spread (V50). Results show that only the HDA coil can spread electric fields to the hippocampus, the nucleus accumbens, and the cerebellum with V50 equal to 0.04%, 1.21%, and 6.2%, respectively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established treatment option for advanced stages of Parkinson's disease and other movement disorders. It is known that DBS is susceptible to strong electromagnetic fields (EMFs) that can be generated by various electrical devices at work, home, and in medical environments. EMFs can interfere with the proper functioning of implantable pulse generators (IPGs). Very strong EMFs can generate induction currents in implanted electrodes and even damage the brain. Manufacturers of DBS devices have issued a list of warnings on how to avoid this danger.Strong EMFs can result from natural forces as well. The authors present the case of a 66-year-old woman who was being treated with a rechargeable DBS system for neck dystonia when her apartment was struck by lightning. Domestic electronic devices that were operating during the event were burned and destroyed. The woman's IPG switched off but remained undamaged, and she suffered no neurological consequences. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses to the affordance properties of visual scenes. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006111 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Biologically inspired deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), trained for computer vision tasks, have been found to predict cortical responses with remarkable accuracy. However, the internal operations of these models remain poorly understood, and the factors that account for their success are unknown. Here we develop a set of techniques for using CNNs to gain insights into the computational mechanisms underlying cortical responses. We focused on responses in the occipital place area (OPA), a scene-selective region of dorsal occipitoparietal cortex. In a previous study, we showed that fMRI activation patterns in the OPA contain information about the navigational affordances of scenes; that is, information about where one can and cannot move within the immediate environment. We hypothesized that this affordance information could be extracted using a set of purely feedforward computations. To test this idea, we examined a deep CNN with a feedforward architecture that had been previously trained for scene classification. We found that responses in the CNN to scene images were highly predictive of fMRI responses in the OPA. Moreover the CNN accounted for the portion of OPA variance relating to the navigational affordances of scenes. The CNN could thus serve as an image-computable candidate model of affordance-related responses in the OPA. We then ran a series of in silico experiments on this model to gain insights into its internal operations. These analyses showed that the computation of affordance-related features relied heavily on visual information at high-spatial frequencies and cardinal orientations, both of which have previously been identified as low-level stimulus preferences of scene-selective visual cortex. These computations also exhibited a strong preference for information in the lower visual field, which is consistent with known retinotopic biases in the OPA. Visualizations of feature selectivity within the CNN suggested that affordance-based responses encoded features that define the layout of the spatial environment, such as boundary-defining junctions and large extended surfaces. Together, these results map the sensory functions of the OPA onto a fully quantitative model that provides insights into its visual computations. More broadly, they advance integrative techniques for understanding visual cortex across multiple level of analysis: from the identification of cortical sensory functions to the modeling of their underlying algorithms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> We propose a framework for electromagnetic (EM) simulation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients in radiofrequency (RF) coils. We generated a model of a DBS patient using post-operative head and neck computed tomography (CT) images stitched together into a 'virtual CT' image covering the entire length of the implant. The body was modeled as homogeneous. The implant path extracted from the CT data contained self-intersections, which we corrected automatically using an optimization procedure. Using the CT-derived DBS path, we built a model of the implant including electrodes, helicoidal internal conductor wires, loops, extension cables, and the implanted pulse generator. We also built four simplified models with straight wires, no extension cables and no loops to assess the impact of these simplifications on safety predictions. We simulated EM fields induced by the RF birdcage body coil in the body model, including at the DBS lead tip at both 1.5 Tesla (64 MHz) and 3 Tesla (123 MHz). We also assessed the robustness of our simulation results by systematically varying the EM properties of the body model and the position and length of the DBS implant (sensitivity analysis). The topology correction algorithm corrected all self-intersection and curvature violations of the initial path while introducing minimal deformations (open-source code available at http://ptx.martinos.org/index.php/Main_Page). The unaveraged lead-tip peak SAR predicted by the five DBS models (0.1 mm resolution grid) ranged from 12.8 kW kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (full model, helicoidal conductors) to 43.6 kW kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (no loops, straight conductors) at 1.5 T (3.4-fold variation) and 18.6 kW kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (full model, straight conductors) to 73.8 kW kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (no loops, straight conductors) at 3 T (4.0-fold variation). At 1.5 T and 3 T, the variability of lead-tip peak SAR with respect to the conductivity ranged between 18% and 30%. Variability with respect to the position and length of the DBS implant ranged between 9.5% and 27.6%. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> How do we decide what we do? This is the essence of action control, the process of selecting the most appropriate response among multiple possible choices. Suboptimal action control can involve a failure to initiate or adapt actions, or conversely it can involve making actions impulsively. There has been an increasing focus on the specific role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in action control. This has been fueled by the clinical relevance of this basal ganglia nucleus as a target for deep brain stimulation (DBS), primarily in Parkinson's disease but also in obsessive-compulsive disorder. The context of DBS has opened windows to study STN function in ways that link neuroscientific and clinical fields closely together, contributing to an exceptionally high level of two-way translation. In this review, we first outline the role of the STN in both motor and nonmotor action control, and then discuss how these functions might be implemented by neuronal activity in the STN. Gaining a better understanding of these topics will not only provide important insights into the neurophysiology of action control but also the pathophysiological mechanisms relevant for several brain disorders and their therapies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation of the ventral striatal area for poststroke pain syndrome: a magnetoencephalography study. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1152/jn.00830.2017 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Poststroke pain syndrome (PSPS) is an often intractable disorder characterized by hemiparesis associated with unrelenting chronic pain. Although traditional analgesics have largely failed, integrative approaches targeting affective-cognitive spheres have started to show promise. Recently, we demonstrated that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral striatal area significantly improved the affective sphere of pain in patients with PSPS. In the present study, we examined whether electrophysiological correlates of pain anticipation were modulated by DBS that could serve as signatures of treatment effects. We recorded event-related fields (ERFs) of pain anticipation using magnetoencephalography (MEG) in 10 patients with PSPS preoperatively and postoperatively in DBS OFF and ON states. Simple visual cues evoked anticipation as patients awaited a painful (PS) or nonpainful stimulus (NPS) to the nonaffected or affected extremity. Preoperatively, ERFs showed no difference between PS and NPS anticipation to the affected extremity, possibly due to loss of salience in a network saturated by pain experience. DBS significantly modulated the early N1, consistent with improvements in affective networks involving restoration of salience and discrimination capacity. Additionally, DBS suppressed the posterior P2 (aberrant anticipatory anxiety) while enhancing the anterior N1 (cognitive and emotional regulation) in responders. DBS-induced changes in ERFs could potentially serve as signatures for clinical outcomes. NEW &amp;amp; NOTEWORTHY We examined the electrophysiological correlates of pain affect in poststroke pain patients who underwent deep brain stimulation (DBS) targeting the ventral striatal area under a randomized, controlled trial. DBS significantly modulated early event-related components, particularly N1 and P2, measured with magnetoencephalography during a pain anticipatory task, compared with baseline and the DBS-OFF condition, pointing to possible mechanisms of action. DBS-induced changes in event-related fields could potentially serve as biomarkers for clinical outcomes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1002/hbm.23977 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Thermoreception is an important cutaneous sense, which plays a role in the maintenance of our body temperature and in the detection of potential noxious heat stimulation. In this study, we investigated event-related fields (ERFs) and neural oscillatory activities, which were modulated by warmth stimulation. We developed a warmth stimulator that could elicit a warmth sensation, without pain or tactile sensation, by using a deep-penetrating 980-nm diode laser. The index finger of each participant (n = 24) was irradiated with the laser warmth stimulus, and the cortical responses were measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG). The ERFs and oscillatory responses had late latencies (∼1.3 s and 1.0-1.5 s for ERFs and oscillatory responses, respectively), which could be explained by a slow conduction velocity of warmth-specific C-fibers. Cortical sources of warmth-related ERFs were seen in the bilateral primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (SI and SII), posterior part of the anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), ipsilateral primary motor, and premotor cortex. Thus, we suggested that SI, SII, and pACC play a role in processing the warmth sensation. Time-frequency analysis demonstrated the suppression of the alpha (8-13 Hz) and beta (18-23 Hz) band power in the bilateral sensorimotor cortex. We proposed that the suppressions in alpha and beta band power are involved in the automatic response to the input of warmth stimulation and sensorimotor interactions. The delta band power (1-4 Hz) increased in the frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortices. The power changes in delta band might be related with the attentional processes during the warmth stimulation. </td>

However, specifics on the underlying brain circuitry that is directly modulated by DBS electric fields remain relatively undefined. Detailed biophysical modeling of DBS provides an approach to quantify the theoretical responses to stimulation at the cellular level, and has established a key role for axonal activation in the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS. Estimates of DBS-induced axonal activation can then be coupled with advances in defining the structural connectome of the human brain to provide insight into the modulated brain circuitry and possible correlations with clinical outcomes. These pathway-activation models (PAMs) represent powerful tools for DBS research, but the theoretical predictions are highly dependent upon the underlying assumptions of the particular modeling strategy used to create the PAM. In general, three types of PAMs are used to estimate activation: 1) field-cable (FC) models, 2) driving force (DF) models, and 3) volume of tissue activated (VTA) models. FC models represent the &amp;quot;gold standard&amp;quot; for analysis but at the cost of extreme technical demands and computational resources. Consequently, DF and VTA PAMs, derived from simplified FC models, are typically used in clinical research studies, but the relative accuracy of these implementations is unknown. Therefore, we performed a head-to-head comparison of the different PAMs, specifically evaluating DBS of three different axonal pathways in the subthalamic region. The DF PAM was markedly more accurate than the VTA PAMs, but none of these simplified models were able to match the results of the patient-specific FC PAM across all pathways and combinations of stimulus parameters. These results highlight the limitations of using simplified predictors to estimate axonal stimulation and emphasize the need for novel algorithms that are both biophysically realistic and computationally simple. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Optimization-Based Contact Fault Alleviation in Deep Brain Stimulation Leads. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/TNSRE.2017.2769707 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a neurosurgical treatment in, e.g., Parkinson's Disease. Electrical stimulation in DBS is delivered to a certain target through electrodes implanted into the brain. Recent developments aiming at better stimulation target coverage and lesser side effects have led to an increase in the number of contacts in a DBS lead as well as higher hardware complexity. This paper proposes an optimization-based approach to alleviation of the fault impact on the resulting therapeutical effect in field steering DBS. Faulty contacts could be an issue given recent trends of increasing number of contacts in DBS leads. Hence, a fault detection/alleviation scheme, such as the one proposed in this paper, is necessary ensure resilience in the chronic stimulation. Two alternatives are considered and compared with the stimulation prior to the fault: one using higher amplitudes on the remaining contacts and another with alleviating contacts in the neighborhood of the faulty one. Satisfactory compensation for a faulty contact can be achieved in both ways. However, to designate alleviating contacts, a model-based optimization procedure is necessary. Results suggest that stimulating with more contacts yields configurations that are more robust to contact faults, though with reduced selectivity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1002/cnm.2958 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> An error-controlled mesh refinement procedure for needle insertion simulations is presented. As an example, the procedure is applied for simulations of electrode implantation for deep brain stimulation. We take into account the brain shift phenomena occurring when a craniotomy is performed. We observe that the error in the computation of the displacement and stress fields is localised around the needle tip and the needle shaft during needle insertion simulation. By suitably and adaptively refining the mesh in this region, our approach enables to control, and thus to reduce, the error whilst maintaining a coarser mesh in other parts of the domain. Through academic and practical examples we demonstrate that our adaptive approach, as compared with a uniform coarse mesh, increases the accuracy of the displacement and stress fields around the needle shaft and, while for a given accuracy, saves computational time with respect to a uniform finer mesh. This facilitates real-time simulations. The proposed methodology has direct implications in increasing the accuracy, and controlling the computational expense of the simulation of percutaneous procedures such as biopsy, brachytherapy, regional anaesthesia, or cryotherapy. Moreover, the proposed approach can be helpful in the development of robotic surgeries because the simulation taking place in the control loop of a robot needs to be accurate, and to occur in real time. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1039/C7RA07603G </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Pulsed electric fields interact with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and have been shown to increase the BBB permeability under some pulsing regimes. Pulsed electric fields may enhance drug delivery to the brain by disrupting the integrity of the BBB and allowing otherwise impermeable drugs to reach target areas. Microfluidic, in vitro models offer an alternative platform for exploring the impact of pulsed electric fields on the BBB because they create physiologically relevant microenvironments and eliminate the confounding variables of animal studies. We developed a microfluidic platform for real-time measurement of BBB permeability pre- and post-treatment with pulsed electric fields. Permeability is measured optically by the diffusion of fluorescent tracers across a monolayer of human cerebral microcapillary endothelial cells (hCMECs) cultured on a permeable membrane. We found that this device is able to capture real-time permeability of hCMEC monolayers for both reversible and irreversible electroporation pulsing regimes. Furthermore, preliminary testing of deep brain stimulation pulsing regimes reveals possible impacts on BBB integrity. This device will enable future studies of pulsed electric field regimes for improved understanding of BBB permeabilization. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3389/fnins.2017.00646 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The ability to adaptively minimize not only motor but cognitive symptoms of neurological diseases, such as Parkinson's Disease (PD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), is a primary goal of next-generation deep brain stimulation (DBS) devices. On the basis of studies demonstrating a link between beta-band synchronization and severity of motor symptoms in PD, the minimization of beta band activity has been proposed as a potential training target for closed-loop DBS. At present, no comparable signal is known for the impulsive side effects of PD, though multiple studies have implicated theta band activity within the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the site of DBS treatment, in processes of conflict monitoring and countermanding. Here, we address this challenge by recording from multiple independent channels within the STN in a self-paced decision task to test whether these signals carry information sufficient to predict stopping behavior on a trial-by-trial basis. As in previous studies, we found that local field potentials (LFPs) exhibited modulations preceding self-initiated movements, with power ramping across multiple frequencies during the deliberation period. In addition, signals showed phasic changes in power around the time of decision. However, a prospective model that attempted to use these signals to predict decision times showed effects of risk level did not improve with the addition of LFPs as regressors. These findings suggest information tracking the lead-up to impulsive choices is distributed across multiple frequency scales in STN, though current techniques may not possess sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to predict-and thus curb-impulsive behavior on a moment-to-moment basis. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s00429-017-1570-4 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The H fields of Forel constitute an intricate neuroanatomical structure that occupies a central position within the posterior subthalamus. Anatomically, it features a dense concentration of fiber bundles including corticofugal, pallidothalamic, cerebellothalamic and other projections that connect functionally relevant areas of the brain. Functionally, the fields of Forel are embedded within the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuit and constitute the main link between the striatopallidal system and the thalamocortical network. Given the current understanding of basal ganglia involvement in movement disorders and neuropsychiatric disease we sought to investigate the H fields of Forel as a potential target in stereotactic functional neurosurgery. Although historically recognized in the treatment of movement disorders, behavioral disorders and epilepsy, the significance of the H fields is considerably diminished today receiving only little attention. Owing to the current lack of reviews addressing the anatomical and functional organization of Forel's fields, we aim to deliver an up-to-date overview of the H fields in this paper. We investigate the complex neuroanatomy and describe the passage of the various fiber systems that course through the posterior subthalamus. We revise the role of Forel's fields in the current context of our understanding of cortico-basal ganglia circuitry and discuss the historic relevance of Forel's fields during the lesional era. Finally, we provide an outlook regarding the potential of deep brain stimulation in close proximity and within the H fields of Forel. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Micro-magnetic stimulation (μMS) is an emerging neurostimulation technology that promises to revolutionize the therapeutic stimulation of the human nervous system. μMS uses sub-millimeter sized coils that can be implemented in the central nervous system to elicit neuronal activation using magnetically induced electric currents. By their microscopic size, μMS coils can be acutely implanted in deep brain structures to deliver therapeutic stimulation with effects analogous to those achieved by state-of-the-art deep brain stimulation (DBS). However, μMS technology has inherent advantages that make it particularly appealing for clinical applications. Specifically, μMS induces a focal electric current in the tissue, limiting the extent of activation to a few hundred microns. We recently demonstrated the feasibility of using μMS to elicit neuronal activation in vitro [1], as well as the possibility of activating neuronal circuitry on the system level in rodents [2]. As μMS is a novel technology, its mechanism(s) of nerve activation, induced field characteristics, and optimum topological features are yet to be explored. In this regard, numerical simulations play a crucially important role, because they provide an insight into spatial distribution of induced electric fields, which in turn, dictate the dynamics of nerve stimulation. Here we report results of numerical simulations to predict the nerve-stimulation performance of different μMS geometries. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1002/bem.22083 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Modulations of epigenetic machinery, namely DNA methylation pattern, histone modification, and non-coding RNAs expression, have been recently included among the key determinants contributing to Parkinson's Disease (PD) aetiopathogenesis and response to therapy. Along this line of reasoning, a set of experimental findings are highlighting the epigenetic-based response to electromagnetic (EM) therapies used to alleviate PD symptomatology, mainly Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS). Notwithstanding the proven efficacy of EM therapies, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the brain response to these types of stimulations are still far from being elucidated. In this review we provide an overview of the epigenetic changes triggered by DBS and TMS in both PD patients and neurons from different experimental animal models. Furthermore, we also propose a critical overview of the exposure modalities currently applied, in order to evaluate the technical robustness and dosimetric control of the stimulation, which are key issues to be carefully assessed when new molecular findings emerge from experimental studies.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease are increasingly treated with deep brain stimulators. Being implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the chest region, thoracic surgical procedures can interfere with such devices, as they are sensible to external electromagnetic forces. Monopolar electrocautery can lead to dysfunction of the device or damage of the brain tissue caused by heat. We report a series of 3 patients with deep brain stimulators who underwent thoracic surgery. By turning off the deep brain stimulators before surgery and avoiding the use of monopolar cautery, electromagnetic interactions were avoided in all patients. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Establishing how neurocircuit activation causes particular behaviors requires modulating the activity of specific neurons. Here, we demonstrate that magnetothermal genetic stimulation provides tetherless deep brain activation sufficient to evoke motor behavior in awake mice. The approach uses alternating magnetic fields to heat superparamagnetic nanoparticles on the neuronal membrane. Neurons, heat-sensitized by expressing TRPV1 are activated with magnetic field application. Magnetothermal genetic stimulation in the motor cortex evoked ambulation, deep brain stimulation in the striatum caused rotation around the body-axis, and stimulation near the ridge between ventral and dorsal striatum caused freezing-of-gait. The duration of the behavior correlated tightly with field application. This approach provides genetically and spatially targetable, repeatable and temporarily precise activation of deep-brain circuits without the need for surgical implantation of any device. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3389/fnhum.2017.00308 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The current rationale for target selection in Tourette syndrome revolves around the notion of cortico-basal ganglia circuit involvement in the pathophysiology of the disease. However, despite extensive research, the ideal target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) is still under debate, with many structures being neglected and underexplored. Based on clinical observations and taking into account the prevailing hypotheses of network processing in Tourette syndrome, we chose the fields of Forel, namely field H1, as a target for DBS. The fields of Forel constitute the main link between the striatopallidal system and the thalamocortical network, relaying pallidothalamic projections from core anatomical structures to the thalamic ventral nuclear group. In a retrospective study we investigated two patients suffering from chronic, medically intractable Tourette syndrome who underwent bilateral lead implantation in field H1 of Forel. Clinical scales revealed significant alleviation of tics and comorbid symptoms, namely depression and anxiety, in the postoperative course in both patients. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Understanding which cellular compartments are influenced during neuromodulation underpins any rational effort to explain and optimize outcomes. Axon terminals have long been speculated to be sensitive to polarization, but experimentally informed models for CNS stimulation are lacking. We conducted simultaneous intracellular recording from the neuron soma and axon terminal (blebs) during extracellular stimulation with weak sustained (DC) uniform electric fields in mouse cortical slices. Use of weak direct current stimulation (DCS) allowed isolation and quantification of changes in axon terminal biophysics, relevant to both suprathreshold (e.g., deep brain stimulation, spinal cord stimulation, and transcranial magnetic stimulation) and subthreshold (e.g., transcranial DCS and transcranial alternating current stimulation) neuromodulation approaches. Axon terminals polarized with sensitivity (mV of membrane polarization per V/m electric field) 4 times than somas. Even weak polarization (&amp;lt;2 mV) of axon terminals significantly changes action potential dynamics (including amplitude, duration, conduction velocity) in response to an intracellular pulse. Regarding a cellular theory of neuromodulation, we explain how suprathreshold CNS stimulation activates the action potential at terminals while subthreshold approaches modulate synaptic efficacy through axon terminal polarization. We demonstrate that by virtue of axon polarization and resulting changes in action potential dynamics, neuromodulation can influence analog-digital information processing. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The surge in the interest in personalized medicine necessitates a corresponding rational approach for implementing such individualized therapies. Dynamiceuticals represents a natural extension of the Pharmaceutical and Electroceutical fields, where the precise determination of the dynamical regimes of the pathophysiology will guide to devise therapies that ameliorate the pathology in a well-controlled manner, thus being precisely tailored toward the implementation of individualized medicine. This approach foretells to lessen side-effects and achieve superior efficacy as compared with current trial-and-error or open-loop strategies. But does the current state of knowledge and technology allow this scheme to offer what it claims? </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0179214 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Tumor treating fields (TTFields) are increasingly used in the treatment of glioblastoma. TTFields inhibit cancer growth through induction of alternating electrical fields. To optimize TTFields efficacy, it is necessary to understand the factors determining the strength and distribution of TTFields. In this study, we provide simple guiding principles for clinicians to assess the distribution and the local efficacy of TTFields in various clinical scenarios.METHODS: We calculated the TTFields distribution using finite element methods applied to a realistic head model. Dielectric property estimates were taken from the literature. Twentyfour tumors were virtually introduced at locations systematically varied relative to the applied field. In addition, we investigated the impact of central tumor necrosis on the induced field.RESULTS: Local field &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot; occurred at the sulcal fundi and in deep tumors embedded in white matter. The field strength was not higher for tumors close to the active electrode. Left/right field directions were generally superior to anterior/posterior directions. Central necrosis focally enhanced the field near tumor boundaries perpendicular to the applied field and introduced significant field non-uniformity within the tumor.CONCLUSIONS: The TTFields distribution is largely determined by local conductivity differences. The well conducting tumor tissue creates a preferred pathway for current flow, which increases the field intensity in the tumor boundaries and surrounding regions perpendicular to the applied field. The cerebrospinal fluid plays a significant role in shaping the current pathways and funnels currents through the ventricles and sulci towards deeper regions, which thereby experience higher fields. Clinicians may apply these principles to better understand how TTFields will affect individual patients and possibly predict where local recurrence may occur. Accurate predictions should, however, be based on patient specific models. Future work is needed to assess the robustness of the presented results towards variations in conductivity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0178422 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stimulation of deeper brain structures by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) plays a role in the study of reward and motivation mechanisms, which may be beneficial in the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, electric field distributions induced in the brain by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) are still unknown. In this paper, the double cone coil, H-coil and Halo-circular assembly (HCA) coil which have been proposed for dTMS have been numerically designed. The distributions of magnetic flux density, induced electric field in an anatomically based realistic head model by applying the dTMS coils were numerically calculated by the impedance method. Results were compared with that of standard figure-of-eight (Fo8) coil. Simulation results show that double cone, H- and HCA coils have significantly deep field penetration compared to the conventional Fo8 coil, at the expense of induced higher and wider spread electrical fields in superficial cortical regions. Double cone and HCA coils have better ability to stimulate deep brain subregions compared to that of the H-coil. In the mean time, both double cone and HCA coils increase risk for optical nerve excitation. Our results suggest although the dTMS coils offer new tool with potential for both research and clinical applications for psychiatric and neurological disorders associated with dysfunctions of deep brain regions, the selection of the most suitable coil settings for a specific clinical application should be based on a balanced evaluation between stimulation depth and focality. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> We report a noninvasive strategy for electrically stimulating neurons at depth. By delivering to the brain multiple electric fields at frequencies too high to recruit neural firing, but which differ by a frequency within the dynamic range of neural firing, we can electrically stimulate neurons throughout a region where interference between the multiple fields results in a prominent electric field envelope modulated at the difference frequency. We validated this temporal interference (TI) concept via modeling and physics experiments, and verified that neurons in the living mouse brain could follow the electric field envelope. We demonstrate the utility of TI stimulation by stimulating neurons in the hippocampus of living mice without recruiting neurons of the overlying cortex. Finally, we show that by altering the currents delivered to a set of immobile electrodes, we can steerably evoke different motor patterns in living mice. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE During the last 3 decades, robotic technology has rapidly spread across several surgical fields due to the continuous evolution of its versatility, stability, dexterity, and haptic properties. Neurosurgery pioneered the development of robotics, with the aim of improving the quality of several procedures requiring a high degree of accuracy and safety. Moreover, robot-guided approaches are of special interest in pediatric patients, who often have altered anatomy and challenging relationships between the diseased and eloquent structures. Nevertheless, the use of robots has been rarely reported in children. In this work, the authors describe their experience using the ROSA device (Robotized Stereotactic Assistant) in the neurosurgical management of a pediatric population. METHODS Between 2011 and 2016, 116 children underwent ROSA-assisted procedures for a variety of diseases (epilepsy, brain tumors, intra- or extraventricular and tumor cysts, obstructive hydrocephalus, and movement and behavioral disorders). Each patient received accurate preoperative planning of optimal trajectories, intraoperative frameless registration, surgical treatment using specific instruments held by the robotic arm, and postoperative CT or MR imaging. RESULTS The authors performed 128 consecutive surgeries, including implantation of 386 electrodes for stereo-electroencephalography (36 procedures), neuroendoscopy (42 procedures), stereotactic biopsy (26 procedures), pallidotomy (12 procedures), shunt placement (6 procedures), deep brain stimulation procedures (3 procedures), and stereotactic cyst aspiration (3 procedures). For each procedure, the authors analyzed and discussed accuracy, timing, and complications. CONCLUSIONS To the best their knowledge, the authors present the largest reported series of pediatric neurosurgical cases assisted by robotic support. The ROSA system provided improved safety and feasibility of minimally invasive approaches, thus optimizing the surgical result, while minimizing postoperative morbidity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7591203 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) are low intensity alternating electric fields in the 100-500 KHz frequency range that are known to have an anti-mitotic effect on cancerous cells. In the USA, TTFields are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM) in both the newly diagnosed and recurrent settings. Optimizing treatment with TTFields requires a deep understanding of how TTFields distribute within the brain. To address this issue, simulations using realistic head models have been performed. However, the preparation of such models is time-consuming and requires a high level of expertise, limiting the usefulness of these models for systematic studies in which the testing of multiple cases is required. Here we present a platform for rapidly simulating TTFields distributions in multiple scenarios. This platform enables high throughput computational simulations to be performed, allowing comparison of field distributions within the head in multiple clinically relevant scenarios. The simulation setup is simple and intuitive, allowing non-expert users to run simulations and evaluate results, thereby providing a valuable tool for studying how to optimize TTFields delivery in the clinic. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/EMBC.2016.7590651 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> One of the most commonly used therapy to treat patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN). Identifying the most optimal target area for the placement of the DBS electrodes have become one of the intensive research area. In this study, the first aim is to investigate the capabilities of different source-analysis techniques in detecting deep sources located at the sub-cortical level and validating it using the a-priori information about the location of the source, that is, the STN. Secondly, we aim at an investigation of whether EEG or MEG is best suited in mapping the DBS-induced brain activity. To do this, simultaneous EEG and MEG measurement were used to record the DBS-induced electromagnetic potentials and fields. The boundary-element method (BEM) have been used to solve the forward problem. The position of the DBS electrodes was then estimated using the dipole (moving, rotating, and fixed MUSIC), and current-density-reconstruction (CDR) (minimum-norm and sLORETA) approaches. The source-localization results from the dipole approaches demonstrated that the fixed MUSIC algorithm best localizes deep focal sources, whereas the moving dipole detects not only the region of interest but also neighboring regions that are affected by stimulating the STN. The results from the CDR approaches validated the capability of sLORETA in detecting the STN compared to minimum-norm. Moreover, the source-localization results using the EEG modality outperformed that of the MEG by locating the DBS-induced activity in the STN. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1038/nature21394 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The retina extracts visual features for transmission to the brain. Different types of bipolar cell split the photoreceptor input into parallel channels and provide the excitatory drive for downstream visual circuits. Mouse bipolar cell types have been described at great anatomical and genetic detail, but a similarly deep understanding of their functional diversity is lacking. Here, by imaging light-driven glutamate release from more than 13,000 bipolar cell axon terminals in the intact retina, we show that bipolar cell functional diversity is generated by the interplay of dendritic excitatory inputs and axonal inhibitory inputs. The resulting centre and surround components of bipolar cell receptive fields interact to decorrelate bipolar cell output in the spatial and temporal domains. Our findings highlight the importance of inhibitory circuits in generating functionally diverse excitatory pathways and suggest that decorrelation of parallel visual pathways begins as early as the second synapse of the mouse visual system. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1002/mrm.26613 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: We introduce a new MR-based method to determine the transfer function (TF) for radiofrequency (RF) safety assessment of active implantable medical devices. Transfer functions are implant-specific measures that relate the incident tangential electric field on an (elongated) implant to a scattered electric field at its tip. The proposed method allows for TF determination with a high spatial resolution in relatively fast measurements without requiring dedicated bench setups from MRI images.THEORY AND METHODS: The principle of reciprocity is used in conjunction with the potential to measure currents with MRI to determine TF. Low-flip angle 3D dual gradient echo MRI data are acquired with an implant as transceive antenna, which requires minimal hardware adaptations. The implant-specific TF is determined from the acquired MRI data, with two different postprocessing methods for comparison.RESULTS: TFs of linear and helical implants can be determined accurately (with a Pearson correlation coefficient R ≥ 0.7 between measurements and simulations, and a difference in field at the tip ΔEtip ≤ 19%) from relatively quick (t &amp;lt; 20 minutes) MRI acquisitions with (several) millimeter spatial resolution.CONCLUSION: Transfer function determination with MRI for RF safety assessment of implantable medical devices is possible. The proposed MR-based method allows for TF determination in more realistic exposure scenarios and solid media.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A novel assistive method for rigidity evaluation during deep brain stimulation surgery using acceleration sensors. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3171/2016.8.JNS152770 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE Despite the widespread use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD), the exact anatomical target responsible for the therapeutic effect is still a subject of research. Intraoperative stimulation tests by experts consist of performing passive movements of the patient's arm or wrist while the amplitude of the stimulation current is increased. At each position, the amplitude that best alleviates rigidity is identified. Intrarater and interrater variations due to the subjective and semiquantitative nature of such evaluations have been reported. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the use of an acceleration sensor attached to the evaluator's wrist to assess the change in rigidity, hypothesizing that such a change will alter the speed of the passive movements. Furthermore, the combined analysis of such quantitative results with anatomy would generate a more reproducible description of the most effective stimulation sites. METHODS To test the reliability of the method, it was applied during postoperative follow-up examinations of 3 patients. To study the feasibility of intraoperative use, it was used during 9 bilateral DBS operations in patients suffering from PD. Changes in rigidity were calculated by extracting relevant outcome measures from the accelerometer data. These values were used to identify rigidity-suppressing stimulation current amplitudes, which were statistically compared with the amplitudes identified by the neurologist. Positions for the chronic DBS lead implantation that would have been chosen based on the acceleration data were compared with clinical choices. The data were also analyzed with respect to the anatomical location of the stimulating electrode. RESULTS Outcome measures extracted from the accelerometer data were reproducible for the same evaluator, thus providing a reliable assessment of rigidity changes during intraoperative stimulation tests. Of the 188 stimulation sites analyzed, the number of sites where rigidity-suppressing amplitudes were found increased from 144 to 170 when the accelerometer evaluations were considered. In general, rigidity release could be observed at significantly lower amplitudes with accelerometer evaluation (mean 0.9 ± 0.6 mA) than with subjective evaluation (mean 1.4 ± 0.6 mA) (p &amp;lt; 0.001). Of 14 choices for the implant location of the DBS lead, only 2 were the same for acceleration-based and subjective evaluations. The comparison across anatomical locations showed that stimulation in the fields of Forel ameliorates rigidity at similar amplitudes as stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus, but with fewer side effects. CONCLUSIONS This article describes and validates a new assistive method for assessing rigidity with acceleration sensors during intraoperative stimulation tests in DBS procedures. The initial results indicate that the proposed method may be a clinically useful aid for optimal DBS lead placement as well as a new tool in the ongoing scientific search for the optimal DBS target for PD. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electrical brain stimulation (EBS) complements neural measurements by probing the causal relationship between brain and perception, cognition, and action. Many fundamental questions about EBS remain unanswered, including the spatial extent of cortex responsive to stimulation, and the relationship between the circuitry engaged by EBS and the types of neural responses elicited by sensory stimulation. Here, we measured neural responses and the effects of EBS in primary visual cortex in four patients implanted with intracranial electrodes. Using stimulation, behavior, and retinotopic mapping, we show the relationship between the size of affected cortical area and the magnitude of electrical charge. Furthermore, we show that the spatial location of electrically induced visual sensations is matched to the receptive field of the cortical site measured with broadband field potentials, and less so with event related potentials. Together, these findings broaden our knowledge about the mechanism of EBS and the neuromodulation of the human brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation within or adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) represents the most common stereotactic procedure performed for Parkinson disease. Better STN imaging is often regarded as a requirement for improving stereotactic targeting. However, it is unclear whether there is consensus about the optimal target.METHODS: To obtain an expert opinion on the site regarded optimal for &amp;quot;STN stimulation,&amp;quot; movement disorder specialists were asked to indicate their preferred position for an active contact on hard copies of the Schaltenbrand and Wahren atlas depicting the STN in all 3 planes. This represented an idealized setting, and it mimicked optimal imaging for direct target definition in a perfectly delineated STN.RESULTS: The suggested targets were heterogeneous, although some clustering was observed in the dorsolateral STN and subthalamic area. In particular, in the anteroposterior direction, the intended targets differed to a great extent. Most of the indicated targets are thought to also result in concomitant stimulation of structures adjacent to the STN, including the zona incerta, fields of Forel, and internal capsule.CONCLUSIONS: This survey illustrates that most sites regarded as optimal for STN stimulation are close to each other, but there appears to be no uniform perception of the optimal anatomic target, possibly influencing surgical results. The anatomic sweet zone for STN stimulation needs further specification, as this information is likely to make magnetic resonance imaging-based target definition less variable when applied to individual patients. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Self-expandable medical devices provide mechanical functionality at a specific location of the human body and are viable for minimal invasive procedures. Besides radiopaque markers and drug-eluting coatings, next generation self-expandable devices can be equipped with additional functionality, such as conductive and flexible electrodes, which enables chronic recording of bioelectrical signals, stimulating or ablating tissue. This promises new therapeutic options in various medical fields, among them in particular neuromodulation (e.g. deep brain stimulation), BioMEMS, radio frequency ablation, mapping or denervation. However, the fabrication of such multi-functional devices is challenging. For this study we have realized a 35 μm thick, superelastic NiTi thin film stent structure with six isolated electrodes on the outer circumference, each electrode connected to a contact pad at the end of the stent structure, using magnetron sputtering, UV lithography and wet chemical etching. Mechanical and electrical properties of the device during typical loading conditions, i.e. crimping, simulated pulsatile and electrochemical testing, were characterized and reveal promising results. For the fabrication of future multifunctional, minimal invasive medical devices, such as electroceuticals or other intelligent implants, NiTi thin film technology is therefore a versatile alternative to conventional fabrication routes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) region has received considerable attention in clinical studies as a target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) in Parkinson disease. These studies have yielded variable results with an overall impression of improvement in falls and freezing in many but not all patients treated. We evaluated the available data on the surgical anatomy and terminology of the PPN region in a companion paper. Here we focus on issues concerning surgical technique, imaging, and early side effects of surgery. The aim of this paper was to gain more insight into the reasoning for choosing specific techniques and to discuss shortcomings of available studies. Our data demonstrate the wide range in almost all fields which were investigated. There are a number of important challenges to be resolved, such as identification of the optimal target, the choice of the surgical approach to optimize electrode placement, the impact on the outcome of specific surgical techniques, the reliability of intraoperative confirmation of the target, and methodological differences in postoperative validation of the electrode position. There is considerable variability both within and across groups, the overall experience with PPN DBS is still limited, and there is a lack of controlled trials. Despite these challenges, the procedure seems to provide benefit to selected patients and appears to be relatively safe. One important limitation in comparing studies from different centers and analyzing outcomes is the great variability in targeting and surgical techniques, as shown in our paper. The challenges we identified will be of relevance when designing future studies to better address several controversial issues. We hope that the data we accumulated may facilitate the development of surgical protocols for PPN DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3390/brainsci6030039 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> New deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrode designs offer operation in voltage and current mode and capability to steer the electric field (EF). The aim of the study was to compare the EF distributions of four DBS leads at equivalent amplitudes (3 V and 3.4 mA). Finite element method (FEM) simulations (n = 38) around cylindrical contacts (leads 3389, 6148) or equivalent contact configurations (leads 6180, SureStim1) were performed using homogeneous and patient-specific (heterogeneous) brain tissue models. Steering effects of 6180 and SureStim1 were compared with symmetric stimulation fields. To make relative comparisons between simulations, an EF isolevel of 0.2 V/mm was chosen based on neuron model simulations (n = 832) applied before EF visualization and comparisons. The simulations show that the EF distribution is largely influenced by the heterogeneity of the tissue, and the operating mode. Equivalent contact configurations result in similar EF distributions. In steering configurations, larger EF volumes were achieved in current mode using equivalent amplitudes. The methodology was demonstrated in a patient-specific simulation around the zona incerta and a &amp;quot;virtual&amp;quot; ventral intermediate nucleus target. In conclusion, lead design differences are enhanced when using patient-specific tissue models and current stimulation mode. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Reduced verbal fluency (VF) has been reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), especially those treated by Deep Brain Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS). To delineate the nature of this dysfunction we aimed at identifying the particular VF-related operations modified by STN DBS.METHOD: Eleven PD patients performed VF tasks in their STN DBS ON and OFF condition. To differentiate VF-components modulated by the stimulation, a temporal cluster analysis was performed, separating production spurts (i.e., 'clusters' as correlates of automatic activation spread within lexical fields) from slower cluster transitions (i.e., 'switches' reflecting set-shifting towards new lexical fields). The results were compared to those of eleven healthy control subjects.RESULTS: PD patients produced significantly more switches accompanied by shorter switch times in the STN DBS ON compared to the STN DBS OFF condition. The number of clusters and time intervals between words within clusters were not affected by the treatment state. Although switch behavior in patients with DBS ON improved, their task performance was still lower compared to that of healthy controls.DISCUSSION: Beyond impacting on motor symptoms, STN DBS seems to influence the dynamics of cognitive procedures. Specifically, the results are in line with basal ganglia roles for cognitive switching, in the particular case of VF, from prevailing lexical concepts to new ones. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1111/ner.12476 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Targeting the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for deep brain stimulation (DBS) using standard stereotactic coordinates in conjunction with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) generally results in effective symptomatic relief for the cardinal motor features of Parkinson's disease (PD). The angle of approach, however, influences the resultant field of stimulation and can lead to undesired side effects.METHODS: We review a case where symptomatic improvement was accompanied by significant side effects despite reasonable STN stereotactic base coordinates. Revision of the lead using similar base coordinates but a significantly different angle of approach greatly improved the outcome.RESULTS: Stimulation ventromedial to the STN improved tremors but brought about dysarthria and dystonia. Computer-based stimulation field modeling helped understand the regions associated with the side effects and illustrate the difference between pre- and post-revision stimulation fields.CONCLUSION: Lead angle can impact DBS outcome and should be taken into consideration. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1167/16.9.11 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> About 20%-30% of patients undergoing neurological rehabilitation report visual field defects, one of the most frequent of which is homonymous hemianopsia (loss of the same half of the visual field in both eyes). There is still no consensus as to whether homonymous hemianopsia is best treated in a restorative or compensatory manner. The aim of this review is to describe the effects of restorative rehabilitation, whose long-term efficacy is still being debated. We analyzed 56 articles describing the use of various techniques used to promote visual field recovery but concentrating on two approaches: &amp;quot;border training,&amp;quot; which involves exercising vision at the edge of the damaged visual field, and &amp;quot;blindsight training,&amp;quot; which is based on exercising unconscious perceptual functions in the mild of the blind hemifield where the scotoma is deep. Both techniques have been supported by functional imaging studies showing evidence of cortical rearrangement (plasticity) after rehabilitation. Although no formal meta-analysis was possible, the results of a semiquantitative evaluation suggested that the improvement in visual skills obtained is related to the type of training used: Border rehabilitation seems to improve the detection of visual stimuli, whereas blindsight rehabilitation seems to improve their processing. Finally, the addition of transcranial direct current stimulation seems to enhance the effects of visual field rehabilitation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1152/jn.00215.2016 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Central poststroke pain (CPSP) is characterized by hemianesthesia associated with unrelenting chronic pain. The final pain experience stems from interactions between sensory, affective, and cognitive components of chronic pain. Hence, managing CPSP will require integrated approaches aimed not only at the sensory but also the affective-cognitive spheres. A better understanding of the brain's processing of pain anticipation is critical for the development of novel therapeutic approaches that target affective-cognitive networks and alleviate pain-related disability. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize the neural substrates of pain anticipation in patients suffering from intractable CPSP. Simple visual cues evoked anticipation while patients awaited impending painful (PS), nonpainful (NPS), or no stimulus (NOS) to their nonaffected and affected extremities. MEG responses were studied at gradiometer level using event-related fields analysis and time-frequency oscillatory analysis upon source localization. On the nonaffected side, significantly greater responses were recorded during PS. PS (vs. NPS and NOS) exhibited significant parietal and frontal cortical activations in the beta and gamma bands, respectively, whereas NPS (vs. NOS) displayed greater activation in the orbitofrontal cortex. On the affected extremity, PS (vs. NPS) did not show significantly greater responses. These data suggest that anticipatory phenomena can modulate neural activity when painful stimuli are applied to the nonaffected extremity but not the affected extremity in CPSP patients. This dichotomy may stem from the chronic effects of pain on neural networks leading to habituation or saturation. Future clinically effective therapies will likely be associated with partial normalization of the neurophysiological correlates of pain anticipation. </td>

Further development of novel neuromodulation techniques employing ultrasound, micro-scale magnetic fields and optogenetics is being propelled by a rapidly improving understanding of the clinical and experimental applications of artificially stimulating or depressing brain activity in human health and disease. With the current rapid growth in neuromodulation technologies and applications, it is timely to review the genesis of the field and the current state of the art in this area. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Movement disorder surgery has evolved throughout history as our knowledge of motor circuits and ways in which to manipulate them have expanded. Today, the positive impact on patient quality of life for a growing number of movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease is now well accepted and confirmed through several decades of randomized, controlled trials. Nevertheless, residual motor symptoms after movement disorder surgery such as deep brain stimulation and lack of a definitive cure for these conditions demand that advances continue to push the boundaries of the field and maximize its therapeutic potential. Similarly, advances in related fields - wireless technology, artificial intelligence, stem cell and gene therapy, neuroimaging, nanoscience, and minimally invasive surgery - mean that movement disorder surgery stands at a crossroads to benefit from unique combinations of all these developments. In this minireview, we outline some of these developments as well as evidence supporting topics of recent discussion and controversy in our field. Moving forward, expectations remain high that these improvements will come to encompass an even broader range of patients who might benefit from this therapy and decrease the burden of disease associated with these conditions. © 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Modelling of the Electric Field Distribution in Deep Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation in the Adolescence, in the Adulthood, and in the Old Age. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1155/2016/9039613 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the last few years, deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) has been used for the treatment of depressive disorders, which affect a broad category of people, from adolescents to aging people. To facilitate its clinical application, particular shapes of coils, including the so-called Hesed coils, were designed. Given their increasing demand and the lack of studies which accurately characterize their use, this paper aims to provide a picture of the distribution of the induced electric field in four realistic human models of different ages and gender. In detail, the electric field distributions were calculated by using numerical techniques in the brain structures potentially involved in the progression of the disease and were quantified in terms of both amplitude levels and focusing power of the distribution. The results highlight how the chosen Hesed coil (H7 coil) is able to induce the maxima levels of E mainly in the prefrontal cortex, particularly for the younger model. Moreover, growing levels of induced electric fields with age were found by going in deep in the brain, as well as a major capability to penetrate in the deepest brain structures with an electric field higher than 50%, 70%, and 90% of the peak found in the cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neuromodulation is a field of science, medicine, and bioengineering that encompasses implantable and non-implantable technologies for the purpose of improving quality of life and functioning of humans. Brain neuromodulation involves different neurostimulation techniques: transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), vagus nerve stimulation (VNS), and deep brain stimulation (DBS), which are being used both to study their effects on cognitive brain functions and to treat neuropsychiatric disorders. The mechanisms of action of neurostimulation remain incompletely understood. Insight into the technical basis of neurostimulation might be a first step towards a more profound understanding of these mechanisms, which might lead to improved clinical outcome and therapeutic potential. This review provides an overview of the technical basis of neurostimulation focusing on the equipment, the present understanding of induced electric fields, and the stimulation protocols. The review is written from a technical perspective aimed at supporting the use of neurostimulation in clinical practice. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Drug-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorder and aggressive behavior are two severely disabling psychiatric conditions which may carry a certain burden on the patients themselves and on their families. In the last decade, the fields of interests of deep brain stimulation (DBS) also encompass psychiatric disorders, supported by imaging and neurophysiological techniques. We here report our institutional experience with the two above-mentioned disorders, describing the procedure commonly employed and the results obtained. Refinement of such techniques, possibly relying on advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), together with probabilistic pictures of field of activation models, could shed more light into this complex field of investigation; further studies are necessary to confirm and make actual results a starting point to new and more precise methodologies in this stimulating research field. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stimulating forebrain communications: Slow sinusoidal electric fields over frontal cortices dynamically modulate hippocampal activity and cortico-hippocampal interplay during slow-wave states. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> S1053-8119(16)00186-5 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Slow-wave states are characterized by the most global physiological phenomenon in the mammalian brain, the large-amplitude slow oscillation (SO; ~1Hz) composed of alternating states of activity (ON/UP states) and silence (OFF/DOWN states) at the network and single cell levels. The SO is cortically generated and appears as a traveling wave that can propagate across the cortical surface and can invade the hippocampus. This cortical rhythm is thought to be imperative for sleep-dependent memory consolidation, potentially through increased interactions with the hippocampus. The SO is correlated with learning and its presumed enhancement via slow rhythmic electrical field stimulation improves subsequent mnemonic performance. However, the mechanism by which such field stimulation influences the dynamics of ongoing cortico-hippocampal communication is unknown. Here we show - using multi-site recordings in urethane-anesthetized rats - that sinusoidal electrical field stimulation applied to the frontal region of the cerebral cortex creates a platform for improved cortico-hippocampal communication. Moderate-intensity field stimulation entrained hippocampal slow activity (likely by way of the temporoammonic pathway) and also increased sharp-wave ripples, the signature memory replay events of the hippocampus, and further increased cortical spindles. Following cessation of high-intensity stimulation, SO interactions in the cortical-to-hippocampal direction were reduced, while the reversed hippocampal-to-cortical communication at both SO and gamma bandwidths was enhanced. Taken together, these findings suggest that cortical field stimulation may function to boost memory consolidation by strengthening cortico-hippocampal and hippocampo-cortical interplay at multiple nested frequencies in an intensity-dependent fashion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3171/2015.7.JNS15379 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a well-established therapy for motor symptoms in patients with pharmacoresistant Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the procedure, which requires multimodal perioperative exploration such as imaging, electrophysiology, or clinical examination during macrostimulation to secure lead positioning, remains challenging because the STN cannot be reliably visualized using the gold standard, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) at 1.5 T. Thus, there is a need to improve imaging tools to better visualize the STN, optimize DBS lead implantation, and enlarge DBS diffusion. METHODS Gradient-echo sequences such as those used in T2WI suffer from higher distortions at higher magnetic fields than spin-echo sequences. First, a spin-echo 3D SPACE (sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip angle evolutions) FLAIR sequence at 3 T was designed, validated histologically in 2 nonhuman primates, and applied to 10 patients with PD; their data were clinically compared in a double-blind manner with those of a control group of 10 other patients with PD in whom STN targeting was performed using T2WI. RESULTS Overlap between the nonhuman primate STNs segmented on 3D-histological and on 3D-SPACE-FLAIR volumes was high for the 3 most anterior quarters (mean [± SD] Dice scores 0.73 ± 0.11, 0.74 ± 0.06, and 0.60 ± 0.09). STN limits determined by the 3D-SPACE-FLAIR sequence were more consistent with electrophysiological edges than those determined by T2WI (0.9 vs 1.4 mm, respectively). The imaging contrast of the STN on the 3D-SPACE-FLAIR sequence was 4 times higher (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Improvement in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale Part III score (off medication, on stimulation) 12 months after the operation was higher for patients who underwent 3D-SPACE-FLAIR-guided implantation than for those in whom T2WI was used (62.2% vs 43.6%, respectively; p &amp;lt; 0.05). The total electrical energy delivered decreased by 36.3% with the 3D-SPACE-FLAIR sequence (p &amp;lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS 3D-SPACE-FLAIR sequences at 3 T improved STN lead placement under stereotactic conditions, improved the clinical outcome of patients with PD, and increased the benefit/risk ratio of STN-DBS surgery. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.041 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mammalian external genitals show sexual dimorphism [1, 2] and can change size and shape upon sexual arousal. Genitals feature prominently in the oldest pieces of figural art [3] and phallic depictions of penises informed psychoanalytic thought about sexuality [4, 5]. Despite this longstanding interest, the neural representations of genitals are still poorly understood [6]. In somatosensory cortex specifically, many studies did not detect any cortical representation of genitals [7-9]. Studies in humans debate whether genitals are represented displaced below the foot of the cortical body map [10-12] or whether they are represented somatotopically [13-15]. We wondered what a high-resolution mapping of genital representations might tell us about the sexual differentiation of the mammalian brain. We identified genital responses in rat somatosensory cortex in a region previously assigned as arm/leg cortex. Genital responses were more common in males than in females. Despite such response dimorphism, we observed a stunning anatomical monomorphism of cortical penis and clitoris input maps revealed by cytochrome-oxidase-staining of cortical layer 4. Genital representations were somatotopic and bilaterally symmetric, and their relative size increased markedly during puberty. Size, shape, and erect posture give the cortical penis representation a phallic appearance pointing to a role in sexually aroused states. Cortical genital neurons showed unusual multi-body-part responses and sexually dimorphic receptive fields. Specifically, genital neurons were co-activated by distant body regions, which are touched during mounting in the respective sex. Genital maps indicate a deep homology of penis and clitoris representations in line with a fundamentally bi-sexual layout [16] of the vertebrate brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1111/biom.12462 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In many scientific fields, it is a common practice to collect a sequence of 0-1 binary responses from a subject across time, space, or a collection of covariates. Researchers are interested in finding out how the expected binary outcome is related to covariates, and aim at better prediction in the future 0-1 outcomes. Gaussian processes have been widely used to model nonlinear systems; in particular to model the latent structure in a binary regression model allowing nonlinear functional relationship between covariates and the expectation of binary outcomes. A critical issue in modeling binary response data is the appropriate choice of link functions. Commonly adopted link functions such as probit or logit links have fixed skewness and lack the flexibility to allow the data to determine the degree of the skewness. To address this limitation, we propose a flexible binary regression model which combines a generalized extreme value link function with a Gaussian process prior on the latent structure. Bayesian computation is employed in model estimation. Posterior consistency of the resulting posterior distribution is demonstrated. The flexibility and gains of the proposed model are illustrated through detailed simulation studies and two real data examples. Empirical results show that the proposed model outperforms a set of alternative models, which only have either a Gaussian process prior on the latent regression function or a Dirichlet prior on the link function. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Columnar arrangements of neurons with similar preference have been suggested as the fundamental processing units of the cerebral cortex. Within these columnar arrangements, feed-forward information enters at middle cortical layers whereas feedback information arrives at superficial and deep layers. This interplay of feed-forward and feedback processing is at the core of perception and behavior. Here we provide in vivo evidence consistent with a columnar organization of the processing of sound frequency in the human auditory cortex. We measure submillimeter functional responses to sound frequency sweeps at high magnetic fields (7 tesla) and show that frequency preference is stable through cortical depth in primary auditory cortex. Furthermore, we demonstrate that-in this highly columnar cortex-task demands sharpen the frequency tuning in superficial cortical layers more than in middle or deep layers. These findings are pivotal to understanding mechanisms of neural information processing and flow during the active perception of sounds. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3389/fnint.2015.00052 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The enormous increase in numbers of scientific publications in the last decades requires quantitative methods for obtaining a better understanding of topics and developments in various fields. In this exploratory study, we investigate the emergence, trends, and connections of topics within the whole text corpus of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) literature based on more than 7000 papers (title and abstracts) published between 1991 to 2014 using a network approach. Taking the co-occurrence of basic terms that represent important topics within DBS as starting point, we outline the statistics of interconnections between DBS indications, anatomical targets, positive, and negative effects, as well as methodological, technological, and economic issues. This quantitative approach confirms known trends within the literature (e.g., regarding the emergence of psychiatric indications). The data also reflect an increased discussion about complex issues such as personality connected tightly to the ethical context, as well as an apparent focus on depression as important DBS indication, where the co-occurrence of terms related to negative effects is low both for the indication as well as the related anatomical targets. We also discuss consequences of the analysis from a bioethical perspective, i.e., how such a quantitative analysis could uncover hidden subject matters that have ethical relevance. For example, we find that hardware-related issues in DBS are far more robustly connected to an ethical context compared to impulsivity, concrete side-effects or death/suicide. Our contribution also outlines the methodology of quantitative text analysis that combines statistical approaches with expert knowledge. It thus serves as an example how innovative quantitative tools can be made useful for gaining a better understanding in the field of DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has had a remarkable success in treating a range of neurological and psychiatric conditions. However, efficacy remains suboptimal and patients can often develop side effects. The underlying causes of both the beneficial and detrimental effects of DBS remain incompletely understood which is delaying improvements to current DBS therapies and limiting developments of future treatments. Advancing this mechanistic understanding will require the design of appropriate models that can formalize the interaction between DBS and the cortico-basal-ganglia network. Recent advances in biophysical modeling have provided important insights into the impact of stimulation at local (neuronal membranes, electrical fields), intermediate (neural networks), and higher (phase, synchronization) levels of description. These have made important contributions to explaining neurophysiological changes during DBS (e.g., spikes, local field potentials), but such models generally do not seek to make accurate predictions about the resultant consequences on behavior. We argue that further advance will rest on models that focus on the specific computations that are performed in cortico-basal-ganglia networks, and address how DBS alters these computations and how this in turn modifies behavior. For the emergent field of computational modeling as applied to Parkinson's disease, we propose that models at mesoscopic levels of description are likely to be most valuable, with a particular focus on the role of oscillations and their relationship to behavior. It is therefore hoped that computational neurostimulation will usher in a new era of rapid, rationally derived DBS advancements for neurological and psychiatric disorders. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation for neurodegenerative disease: a computational blueprint using dynamic causal modeling. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/bs.pbr.2015.07.002 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Advances in deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapeutics for neurological and psychiatric disorders represent a new clinical avenue that may potentially augment or adjunct traditional pharmacological approaches to disease treatment. Using modern molecular biology and genomics, pharmacological development proceeds through an albeit lengthy and expensive pipeline from candidate compound to preclinical and clinical trials. Such a pathway, however, is lacking in the field of neurostimulation, with developments arising from a selection of early sources and motivated by diverse fields including surgery and neuroscience. In this chapter, I propose that biophysical models of connected brain networks optimized using empirical neuroimaging data from patients and healthy controls can provide a principled computational pipeline for testing and developing neurostimulation interventions. Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) provides such a computational framework, serving as a method to test effective connectivity between and within regions of an active brain network. Importantly, the methodology links brain dynamics with behavior by directly assessing experimental task effects under different behavioral or cognitive sets. Therefore, healthy brain dynamics in circuits of interest can be defined mathematically with stimulation interventions in pathological counterparts simulated with the goal of restoring normal functionality. In this chapter, I outline the dynamic characterization of brain circuits using DCM and propose a blueprint for testing in silico, the effects of stimulation in neurodegenerative disorders affecting cognition. In particular, the models can be simulated to test whether neuroimaging correlates of nondiseased brain dynamics can be reinstantiated in a pathological setting using DBS. Thus, the key advantage of this framework is that distributed effects of DBS on neural circuitry and network connectivity can be predicted in silico. The chapter also includes a review of how DCM has been used to characterize the effects of DBS in Parkinson's disease. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Reporting the outcome of two patients who underwent unilateral ablative stereotactic surgery to treat pharmacologic resistant posttraumatic tremor (PTT).METHODS: We present two patients (31 and 47 years old) with refractory PTT severely affecting their quality of life. Under stereotactic guidance, refined by T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and double-channel multiunit microelectrode recording (MER), three sequential radiofrequency lesions were performed in the caudal zona incerta (cZi) up to the base of thalamus (VOP). Effects of cZi/VOP lesion were prospectively rated with a tremor rating scale.RESULTS: Both patients demonstrated intraoperative tremor suppression with sustained results up to 18 months follow-up, with improvement of 92% and 84%, respectively, on the tremor rating scale. Tremor improvement was associated with enhancement functionality and quality of life for the patients. The patients returned to their work after the procedure. No adverse effects were observed up to the last follow-up.CONCLUSION: Radiofrequency lesion of the cZi/VOP target was effective for posttraumatic tremor in both cases. The use of T2-weighted images and MER was found helpful in increasing the precision and safety of the procedure, because it leads the RF probe by relying on neighbor structures based on thalamus and subthalamic nucleus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> After having examined the definition, clinical phenomenology, comorbidity, psychopathology, and phenotypes in the first paper of this Series, here I discuss the assessment, including neuropsychology, and the effects of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome with studies showing that the quality of life of patients with Tourette's syndrome is reduced and that there is a substantial burden on the family. In this paper, I review my local and collaborative studies investigating causal factors (including genetic vulnerability, prenatal and perinatal difficulties, and neuro-immunological factors). I also present my studies on neuro-imaging, electro-encephalograms, and other special investigations, which are helpful in their own right or to exclude other conditions. Finally, I also review our studies on treatment including medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation, biofeedback, target-specific botulinum toxin injections, biofeedback and, in severe refractory adults, psychosurgery and deep brain stimulation. This Review summarises and highlights selected main findings from my clinic (initially The National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery Queen Square and University College London, UK, and, subsequently, at St George's Hospital, London, UK), and several collaborations since 1980. As in Part 1 of this Series, I address the main controversies in the fields and the research of other groups, and I make suggestions for future research. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Management of lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) in neurological diseases remains a priority because it leads to many complications such as incontinence, renal failure and decreased quality of life. A pharmacological approach remains the first-line treatment for patients with neurogenic LUTD, but electrical stimulation is a well-validated and recommended second-line treatment. However, clinicians must be aware of the indications, advantages and side effects of the therapy. This report provides an update on the 2 main electrical stimulation therapies for neurogenic LUTD - inducing direct bladder contraction with the Brindley procedure and modulating LUT physiology (sacral neuromodulation, tibial posterior nerve stimulation or pudendal nerve stimulation). We also describe the indications of these therapies for neurogenic LUTD, following international guidelines, as illustrated by their efficacy in patients with neurologic disorders. Electrical stimulation could be proposed for neurogenic LUTD as second-line treatment after failure of oral pharmacologic approaches. Nevertheless, further investigations are needed for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action of these techniques and to confirm their efficacy. Other electrical investigations, such as deep-brain stimulation and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, or improved sacral anterior root stimulation, which could be associated with non-invasive and highly specific deafferentation of posterior roots, may open new fields in the management of neurogenic LUTD. </td>

A 79-year-old woman with a history of coarse tremors effectively managed with deep brain stimulation presented with multiple intracranial metastases from a newly diagnosed lung cancer and was referred for whole-brain radiation therapy. She was treated with a German helmet technique to a total dose of 30 Gy in 10 fractions using 6 MV photons via opposed lateral fields with the neurostimulator turned off prior to delivery of each fraction. The patient tolerated the treatment well with no acute complications and no apparent change in the functionality of her neurostimulator device or effect on her underlying neuromuscular disorder. This represents the first reported case of the safe delivery of whole-brain radiation therapy in a patient with an implanted neurostimulator device. In cases such as this, neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists should have discussions with patients about the risks of brain injury, device malfunction or failure of the device, and plans for rigorous testing of the device before and after radiation therapy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) alleviates symptoms associated with some neurological disorders by stimulating specific deep brain targets. However, incomplete stimulation of the target region can provide suboptimal therapy, and spread of stimulation to tissue outside the target can generate side-effects. Existing DBS electrodes generate stimulation profiles that are roughly spherical, neither matching nor enabling the mapping of therapeutic targets. We present a novel electrode design and will perform computational modeling of the new design to investigate its use as a next generation DBS electrode.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational simulations of a finite element model are performed for both the novel electrode and for a commercially available DBS electrode.RESULTS: Computational modeling results show that this new electrode design is able to steer stimulation radially around the device, creating voltage distributions that may more closely match deep brain targets.CONCLUSION: The ability to better match the anatomy and compensate for targeting errors during implantation will enable strict localization of the generated stimulation fields to within target tissues, potentially providing more complete symptom alleviation while reducing the occurrence of side-effects. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0134379 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is increasingly used to treat a variety of brain diseases by sending electrical impulses to deep brain nuclei through long, electrically conductive leads. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of patients pre- and post-implantation is desirable to target and position the implant, to evaluate possible side-effects and to examine DBS patients who have other health conditions. Although MRI is the preferred modality for pre-operative planning, MRI post-implantation is limited due to the risk of high local power deposition, and therefore tissue heating, at the tip of the lead. The localized power deposition arises from currents induced in the leads caused by coupling with the radiofrequency (RF) transmission field during imaging. In the present work, parallel RF transmission (pTx) is used to tailor the RF electric field to suppress coupling effects. Electromagnetic simulations were performed for three pTx coil configurations with 2, 4, and 8-elements, respectively. Optimal input voltages to minimize coupling, while maintaining RF magnetic field homogeneity, were determined for all configurations using a Nelder-Mead optimization algorithm. Resulting electric and magnetic fields were compared to that of a 16-rung birdcage coil. Experimental validation was performed with a custom-built 4-element pTx coil. In simulation, 95-99% reduction of the electric field at the tip of the lead was observed between the various pTx coil configurations and the birdcage coil. Maximal reduction in E-field was obtained with the 8-element pTx coil. Magnetic field homogeneity was comparable to the birdcage coil for the 4- and 8-element pTx configurations. In experiment, a temperature increase of 2±0.15°C was observed at the tip of the wire using the birdcage coil, whereas negligible increase (0.2±0.15°C) was observed with the optimized pTx system. Although further research is required, these initial results suggest that the concept of optimizing pTx to reduce DBS heating effects holds considerable promise. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3389/fnins.2015.00237 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Several disorders are related to pathological brain oscillations. In the case of Parkinson's disease, sustained low-frequency oscillations (especially in the β-band, 13-30 Hz) correlate with motor symptoms. It is still under debate whether these oscillations are the cause of parkinsonian motor symptoms. The development of techniques enabling selective disruption of these β-oscillations could contribute to the understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and could be exploited for treatments. A particularly appealing technique is Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS). With clinical electrical DBS, electrical currents are delivered at high frequency to a region made of potentially heterogeneous neurons (the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the case of Parkinson's disease). Even more appealing is DBS with optogenetics, which is until now a preclinical method using both gene transfer and deep brain light delivery and enabling neuromodulation at the scale of one given neural network. In this work, we rely on delayed neural fields models of STN and the external Globus Pallidus (GPe) to develop, theoretically validate and test in silico a closed-loop stimulation strategy to disrupt these sustained oscillations with optogenetics. First, we rely on tools from control theory to provide theoretical conditions under which sustained oscillations can be attenuated by a closed-loop stimulation proportional to the measured activity of STN. Second, based on this theoretical framework, we show numerically that the proposed closed-loop stimulation efficiently attenuates sustained oscillations, even in the case when the photosensitization effectively affects only 50% of STN neurons. We also show through simulations that oscillations disruption can be achieved when the same light source is used for the whole STN population. We finally test the robustness of the proposed strategy to possible acquisition and processing delays, as well as parameters uncertainty. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3171/2015.1.JNS142349 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) is a relatively new imaging technique. Its high sensitivity to hemorrhagic components and ability to depict microvasculature by means of susceptibility effects within the veins allow for the accurate detection, grading, and monitoring of brain tumors. This imaging modality can also detect changes in blood flow to monitor stroke recovery and reveal specific subtypes of vascular malformations. In addition, small punctate lesions can be demonstrated with SWI, suggesting diffuse axonal injury, and the location of these lesions can help predict neurological outcome in patients. This imaging technique is also beneficial for applications in functional neurosurgery given its ability to clearly depict and differentiate deep midbrain nuclei and close submillimeter veins, both of which are necessary for presurgical planning of deep brain stimulation. By exploiting the magnetic susceptibilities of substances within the body, such as deoxyhemoglobin, calcium, and iron, SWI can clearly visualize the vasculature and hemorrhagic components even without the use of contrast agents. The high sensitivity of SWI relative to other imaging techniques in showing tumor vasculature and microhemorrhages suggests that it is an effective imaging modality that provides additional information not shown using conventional MRI. Despite SWI's clinical advantages, its implementation in MRI protocols is still far from consistent in clinical usage. To develop a deeper appreciation for SWI, the authors here review the clinical applications in 4 major fields of neurosurgery: neurooncology, vascular neurosurgery, neurotraumatology, and functional neurosurgery. Finally, they address the limitations of and future perspectives on SWI in neurosurgery. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Functional MRI during Hippocampal Deep Brain Stimulation in the Healthy Rat Brain. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0133245 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a promising treatment for neurological and psychiatric disorders. The mechanism of action and the effects of electrical fields administered to the brain by means of an electrode remain to be elucidated. The effects of DBS have been investigated primarily by electrophysiological and neurochemical studies, which lack the ability to investigate DBS-related responses on a whole-brain scale. Visualization of whole-brain effects of DBS requires functional imaging techniques such as functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which reflects changes in blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) responses throughout the entire brain volume. In order to visualize BOLD responses induced by DBS, we have developed an MRI-compatible electrode and an acquisition protocol to perform DBS during BOLD fMRI. In this study, we investigate whether DBS during fMRI is valuable to study local and whole-brain effects of hippocampal DBS and to investigate the changes induced by different stimulation intensities. Seven rats were stereotactically implanted with a custom-made MRI-compatible DBS-electrode in the right hippocampus. High frequency Poisson distributed stimulation was applied using a block-design paradigm. Data were processed by means of Independent Component Analysis. Clusters were considered significant when p-values were &amp;lt;0.05 after correction for multiple comparisons. Our data indicate that real-time hippocampal DBS evokes a bilateral BOLD response in hippocampal and other mesolimbic structures, depending on the applied stimulation intensity. We conclude that simultaneous DBS and fMRI can be used to detect local and whole-brain responses to circuit activation with different stimulation intensities, making this technique potentially powerful for exploration of cerebral changes in response to DBS for both preclinical and clinical DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Converging evidence suggests that the primate ventral visual pathway encodes increasingly complex stimulus features in downstream areas. We quantitatively show that there indeed exists an explicit gradient for feature complexity in the ventral pathway of the human brain. This was achieved by mapping thousands of stimulus features of increasing complexity across the cortical sheet using a deep neural network. Our approach also revealed a fine-grained functional specialization of downstream areas of the ventral stream. Furthermore, it allowed decoding of representations from human brain activity at an unsurpassed degree of accuracy, confirming the quality of the developed approach. Stimulus features that successfully explained neural responses indicate that population receptive fields were explicitly tuned for object categorization. This provides strong support for the hypothesis that object categorization is a guiding principle in the functional organization of the primate ventral stream. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Injections of Algesic Solutions into Muscle Activate the Lateral Reticular Formation: A Nociceptive Relay of the Spinoreticulothalamic Tract. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0130939 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although musculoskeletal pain disorders are common clinically, the central processing of muscle pain is little understood. The present study reports on central neurons activated by injections of algesic solutions into the gastrocnemius muscle of the rat, and their subsequent localization by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in the spinal cord and brainstem. An injection (300 μl) of an algesic solution (6% hypertonic saline, pH 4.0 acetate buffer, or 0.05% capsaicin) was made into the gastrocnemius muscle and the distribution of immunolabeled neurons compared to that obtained after control injections of phosphate buffered saline [pH 7.0]. Most labeled neurons in the spinal cord were found in laminae IV-V, VI, VII and X, comparing favorably with other studies, with fewer labeled neurons in laminae I and II. This finding is consistent with the diffuse pain perception due to noxious stimuli to muscles mediated by sensory fibers to deep spinal neurons as compared to more restricted pain localization during noxious stimuli to skin mediated by sensory fibers to superficial laminae. Numerous neurons were immunolabeled in the brainstem, predominantly in the lateral reticular formation (LRF). Labeled neurons were found bilaterally in the caudalmost ventrolateral medulla, where neurons responsive to noxious stimulation of cutaneous and visceral structures lie. Immunolabeled neurons in the LRF continued rostrally and dorsally along the intermediate reticular nucleus in the medulla, including the subnucleus reticularis dorsalis caudally and the parvicellular reticular nucleus more rostrally, and through the pons medial and lateral to the motor trigeminal nucleus, including the subcoerulear network. Immunolabeled neurons, many of them catecholaminergic, were found bilaterally in the nucleus tractus solitarii, the gracile nucleus, the A1 area, the CVLM and RVLM, the superior salivatory nucleus, the nucleus locus coeruleus, the A5 area, and the nucleus raphe magnus in the pons. The external lateral and superior lateral subnuclei of the parabrachial nuclear complex were consistently labeled in experimental data, but they also were labeled in many control cases. The internal lateral subnucleus of the parabrachial complex was labeled moderately. Few immunolabeled neurons were found in the medial reticular formation, however, but the rostroventromedial medulla was labeled consistently. These data are discussed in terms of an interoceptive, multisynaptic spinoreticulothalamic path, with its large receptive fields and role in the motivational-affective components of pain perceptions.&lt;/AbstractText&gt;: Although musculoskeletal pain disorders are common clinically, the central processing of muscle pain is little understood. The present study reports on central neurons activated by injections of algesic solutions into the gastrocnemius muscle of the rat, and their subsequent localization by c-Fos immunohistochemistry in the spinal cord and brainstem. An injection (300 μl) of an algesic solution (6% hypertonic saline, pH 4.0 acetate buffer, or 0.05% capsaicin) was made into the gastrocnemius muscle and the distribution of immunolabeled neurons compared to that obtained after control injections of phosphate buffered saline [pH 7.0]. Most labeled neurons in the spinal cord were found in laminae IV-V, VI, VII and X, comparing favorably with other studies, with fewer labeled neurons in laminae I and II. This finding is consistent with the diffuse pain perception due to noxious stimuli to muscles mediated by sensory fibers to deep spinal neurons as compared to more restricted pain localization during noxious stimuli to skin mediated by sensory fibers to superficial laminae. Numerous neurons were immunolabeled in the brainstem, predominantly in the lateral reticular formation (LRF).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possibility for stimulating deeper brain regions while decreasing the electrical field in superficial cortical regions by employing coaxial circular coils.METHODS: The Halo coil, Halo-circular assembly coil (HCA coil) and Halo coil working with two circular coils (HTC coil) were applied over a 36-tissue anatomically based head model. Three-dimensional distributions of magnetic flux density, induced electric field in head tissues were obtained by 3-D impedance method.RESULTS: For the case of HCA coil with current flowing in the same direction in each of two coils, the field penetration depth by the conventional circular coil can be effectively increased at the expense of reduced focality. For the case of the HTC coil with currents flowing in opposite direction in the neighboring coils, overthreshold electric fields can be produced in deep brain regions, while the subthreshold fields were produced in superficial cortical areas.CONCLUSION: The HTC coil with varied coil parameters and different injected currents provides a flexible way for deep brain stimulation with better ratio of deep region field relative to field at the shallow areas.SIGNIFICANCE: The HTC coil is promising for deep transcranial magnetic stimulation, which may offer a new tool with potential for both research and clinical applications for psychiatric and neurological disorders associated with dysfunctions of deep brain regions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/TMI.2015.2442236 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) venography can produce detailed venous contrast and complement arterial dominated MR angiography (MRA) techniques. However, these dense reversed-contrast SWI venograms pose new segmentation challenges. We present an automatic method for whole-brain venous blood segmentation in SWI using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). The CRF model combines different first and second order potentials. First-order association potentials are modeled as the composite of an appearance potential, a Hessian-based shape potential and a non-linear location potential. Second-order interaction potentials are modeled using an auto-logistic (smoothing) potential and a data-dependent (edge) potential. Minimal post-processing is used for excluding voxels outside the brain parenchyma and visualizing the surface vessels. The CRF model is trained and validated using 30 SWI venograms acquired within a population of deep brain stimulation (DBS) patients (age range [Formula: see text] years). Results demonstrate robust and consistent segmentation in deep and sub-cortical regions (median kappa = 0.84 and 0.82), as well as in challenging mid-sagittal and surface regions (median kappa = 0.81 and 0.83) regions. Overall, this CRF model produces high-quality segmentation of SWI venous vasculature that finds applications in DBS for minimizing hemorrhagic risks and other surgical and non-surgical applications. </td>

A surgically attached two-channel electroencephalography headmount has directly measured the modulation of intrinsic electric waveforms by an external a.c. 100-Oe magnetic field in a frequency range of 0-20 Hz.RESULTS: The modulated signal has reached the strength comparable to that due the regular neural activity.CONCLUSION: The study opens a pathway to use multifunctional nanoparticles to control intrinsic fields deep in the brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to examine a bitemporal (BT) transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) electrode montage for the treatment of depression through a clinical pilot study and computational modeling. The safety of repeated courses of stimulation was also examined.METHODS: Four participants with depression who had previously received multiple courses of tDCS received a 4-week course of BT tDCS. Mood and neuropsychological function were assessed. The results were compared with previous courses of tDCS given to the same participants using different electrode montages. Computational modeling examined the electric field maps produced by the different montages.RESULTS: Three participants showed clinical improvement with BT tDCS (mean [SD] improvement, 49.6% [33.7%]). There were no adverse neuropsychological effects. Computational modeling showed that the BT montage activates the anterior cingulate cortices and brainstem, which are deep brain regions that are important for depression. However, a fronto-extracephalic montage stimulated these areas more effectively. No adverse effects were found in participants receiving up to 6 courses of tDCS.CONCLUSIONS: Bitemporal tDCS was safe and led to clinically meaningful efficacy in 3 of 4 participants. However, computational modeling suggests that the BT montage may not activate key brain regions in depression more effectively than another novel montage--fronto-extracephalic tDCS. There is also preliminary evidence to support the safety of up to 6 repeated courses of tDCS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Wireless deep brain stimulation of well-defined neuronal populations could facilitate the study of intact brain circuits and the treatment of neurological disorders. Here, we demonstrate minimally invasive and remote neural excitation through the activation of the heat-sensitive capsaicin receptor TRPV1 by magnetic nanoparticles. When exposed to alternating magnetic fields, the nanoparticles dissipate heat generated by hysteresis, triggering widespread and reversible firing of TRPV1(+) neurons. Wireless magnetothermal stimulation in the ventral tegmental area of mice evoked excitation in subpopulations of neurons in the targeted brain region and in structures receiving excitatory projections. The nanoparticles persisted in the brain for over a month, allowing for chronic stimulation without the need for implants and connectors. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The development of different methods of brain stimulation provides a promising therapeutic tool with potentially beneficial effects on subjects with impaired cognitive functions. We performed a systematic review of the studies published in the field of neurostimulation in Alzheimer's disease (AD), from basic research to clinical applications. The main methods of non-invasive brain stimulation are repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcranial direct current stimulation. Preliminary findings have suggested that both techniques can enhance performances on several cognitive functions impaired in AD. Another non-invasive emerging neuromodulatory approach, the transcranial electromagnetic treatment, was found to reverse cognitive impairment in AD transgenic mice and even improves cognitive performance in normal mice. Experimental studies suggest that high-frequency electromagnetic fields may be critically important in AD prevention and treatment through their action at mitochondrial level. Finally, the application of a widely known invasive technique, the deep brain stimulation (DBS), has increasingly been considered as a therapeutic option also for patients with AD; it has been demonstrated that DBS of fornix/hypothalamus and nucleus basalis of Meynert might improve or at least stabilize cognitive functioning in AD. Initial encouraging results provide support for continuing to investigate non-invasive and invasive brain stimulation approaches as an adjuvant treatment for AD patients. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A passive deep brain stimulation (DBS) device can be equipped with a rectenna, consisting of an antenna and a rectifier, to harvest energy from electromagnetic fields for its operation. This paper presents optimization of radio frequency rectifier circuits for wireless energy harvesting in a passive head-mountable DBS device. The aim is to achieve a compact size, high conversion efficiency, and high output voltage rectifier. Four different rectifiers based on the Delon doubler, Greinacher voltage tripler, Delon voltage quadrupler, and 2-stage charge pumped architectures are designed, simulated, fabricated, and evaluated. The design and simulation are conducted using Agilent Genesys at operating frequency of 915 MHz. A dielectric substrate of FR-4 with thickness of 1.6 mm, and surface mount devices (SMD) components are used to fabricate the designed rectifiers. The performance of the fabricated rectifiers is evaluated using a 915 MHz radio frequency (RF) energy source. The maximum measured conversion efficiency of the Delon doubler, Greinacher tripler, Delon quadrupler, and 2-stage charge pumped rectifiers are 78, 75, 73, and 76 % at -5 dBm input power and for load resistances of 5-15 kΩ. The conversion efficiency of the rectifiers decreases significantly with the increase in the input power level. The Delon doubler rectifier provides the highest efficiency at both -5 and 5 dBm input power levels, whereas the Delon quadrupler rectifier gives the lowest efficiency for the same inputs. By considering both efficiency and DC output voltage, the charge pump rectifier outperforms the other three rectifiers. Accordingly, the optimised 2-stage charge pumped rectifier is used together with an antenna to harvest energy in our DBS device. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/EMBC.2014.6945059 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has been shown to reduce some of the symptoms of advanced, levodopa-responsive Parkinson's disease that are not adequately controlled with medication. However, the precise mechanism of the therapeutic action of DBS is still unclear. Stimulation-induced side effects are not uncommon and require electrical &amp;quot;dose&amp;quot; adjustments. Quantitative methods are needed to fully characterize the electric field in the deep brain region that surrounds the electrodes in order to help with adjustments and maximize the efficacy of the device. Herein we report a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based head model proposed for analysis of fields generated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). The model was derived from multimodal image data at 0.5mm isotropic spatial resolution and distinguishes 142 anatomical structures, including the basal ganglia and 38 nuclei of the thalamus. Six bipolar electrode configurations (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4) were modeled in order to assess the effects of the inter-electrode distance of the electric field. Increasing the distance between the electrodes results in an attenuated stimulation, with up to 25% reduction in electric field amplitude delivered (2-3 vs. 1-4). The map of the deep brain structures provided a highly precise anatomical detail which is useful for the quantitative assessment of current spread around the electrode and a better evaluation of the stimulation setting for the treatment optimization. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/TBME.2014.2363494 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Models and simulations are commonly used to study deep brain stimulation (DBS). Simulated stimulation fields are often defined and visualized by electric field isolevels or volumes of tissue activated (VTA). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between stimulation field strength as defined by the electric potential V, the electric field E, and the divergence of the electric field ∇(2) V, and neural activation. Axon cable models were developed and coupled to finite-element DBS models in three-dimensional (3-D). Field thresholds ( VT , ET, and ∇(2) VT ) were derived at the location of activation for various stimulation amplitudes (1 to 5 V), pulse widths (30 to 120 μs), and axon diameters (2.0 to 7.5 μm). Results showed that thresholds for VT and ∇(2) VT were highly dependent on the stimulation amplitude while ET were approximately independent of the amplitude for large axons. The activation field strength thresholds presented in this study may be used in future studies to approximate the VTA during model-based investigations of DBS without the need of computational axon models. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/TBME.2014.2364297 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The current conduction pathways resulting from monopolar stimulation of the cochlear implant were studied by developing a human electroanatomical total head reconstruction (namely, HEATHER). HEATHER was created from serially sectioned images of the female Visible Human Project dataset to encompass a total of 12 different tissues, and included computer-aided design geometries of the cochlear implant. Since existing methods were unable to generate the required complexity for HEATHER, a new modeling workflow was proposed. The results of the finite-element analysis agree with the literature, showing that the injected current exits the cochlea via the modiolus (14%), the basal end of the cochlea (22%), and through the cochlear walls (64%). It was also found that, once leaving the cochlea, the current travels to the implant body via the cranial cavity or scalp. The modeling workflow proved to be robust and flexible, allowing for meshes to be generated with substantial user control. Furthermore, the workflow could easily be employed to create realistic anatomical models of the human head for different bioelectric applications, such as deep brain stimulation, electroencephalography, and other biophysical phenomena. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the deep brain stimulation (DBS) electric field distribution in proton-density MRI scans visualizing the globus pallidus internus (GPi) of patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS), along with its relation to the anatomy.METHODS: Patient-specific brain tissue models (n = 7) with bilateral DBS electrodes in the GPi were set up using the finite element method in five patients who had undergone stereotactic proton-density MRI-guided surgery and showed variable improvement with DBS. Simulations (n = 27) of the electric field were performed and the results visualized on the respective preoperative stereotactic MRI scans. The mean electric field volumes (n = 81) within the 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 V/mm isosurfaces were calculated and compared with the anatomy.RESULTS: Visualization of the simulated electric field confirmed that the anteromedial limbic GPi was the main stimulated target for four of the patients and the posteromedial sensorimotor GPi for one. Larger volumes extended asymmetrically, with parts of fields stretching into the lamina between GPi and globus pallidus externus and into the internal capsule. There was a high correlation (r = 0.994, n = 54) between volumes and brain sides, but with a systematic shift toward the right side, especially for the larger volumes. Simulations with homogeneous tissue models showed no differences.CONCLUSIONS: Patient-specific DBS electric field simulations in the GPi as visualized on proton-density MR scans can be implemented in patients with GTS. Visualization of electric fields together with stereotactic thin-slice MRI can provide further support when predicting anatomical structures possibly influenced by DBS in this complex disorder. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1227/NEU.0000000000000540 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation alleviates tremor of various origins. Several regions like the ventralis intermediate nucleus of thalamus, the caudal zona incerta, and the posterior subthalamic region are generally targeted. Previous work with fiber tractography has shown the involvement of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network in tremor control.OBJECTIVE: To report the results of a prospective trial in a group of patients with tremor who underwent post hoc tractographic analysis after treatment with traditional thalamic deep brain stimulation.METHODS: A total of 11 patients (aged 64 ± 17 years, 6 male) were enrolled (essential tremor [6], Parkinson tremor [3], and myoclonic tremor in myoclonus dystonia [2]). Patients received 1 (3 patients), 2 (7 patients), or 3 (1 patient) quadripolar electrodes. A 32-direction diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging sequence was acquired preoperatively. Tractography was processed postoperatively for evaluation and the dentato-rubro-thalamic tract (DRT) was individually tracked. Electrode positions were determined with helical computed tomography. Electric fields (EFs) were simulated according to individual stimulation parameters in a standardized atlas brain space (ICBM-MNI 152).RESULTS: Tremor was reduced in all patients (69.4% mean) on the global (bilateral) tremor score. Effective contacts were located inside or in proximity to the DRT. In moderate tremor reduction (2 patients), the EFs were centered on its anterior border. In good and excellent tremor reduction (9 patients), EFs focused on its center.CONCLUSION: Deep brain stimulation of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical network reduces tremor. The DRT connects 3 traditional target regions for deep brain stimulation in tremor disease. Tractography techniques can be used to directly visualize the DRT and, therefore, optimize target definition in individual patients. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Anatomical targets associated with abrupt versus gradual washout of subthalamic deep brain stimulation effects on bradykinesia. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0099663 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a common anatomical target for deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, the effects of stimulation may spread beyond the STN. Ongoing research aims to identify nearby anatomical structures where DBS-induced effects could be associated with therapeutic improvement or side effects. We previously found that DBS lead location determines the rate--abrupt vs. gradual--with which therapeutic effect washes out after stimulation is stopped. Those results suggested that electrical current spreads from the electrodes to two spatially distinct stimulation targets associated with different washout rates. In order to identify these targets we used computational models to predict the volumes of tissue activated during DBS in 14 Parkinson's patients from that study. We then coregistered each patient with a stereotaxic atlas and generated a probabilistic stimulation atlas to obtain a 3-dimensional representation of regions where stimulation was associated with abrupt vs. gradual washout. We found that the therapeutic effect which washed out gradually was associated with stimulation of the zona incerta and fields of Forel, whereas abruptly-disappearing therapeutic effect was associated with stimulation of STN itself. This supports the idea that multiple DBS targets exist and that current spread from one electrode may activate more than one of them in a given patient, producing a combination of effects which vary according to electrode location and stimulation settings. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: Specific absorption rate (SAR) amplification around active implantable medical devices during diagnostic MRI procedures poses a potential risk for patient safety. In this study, we present a parallel transmit (pTx) strategy that can be used to safely scan patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants.METHODS: We performed electromagnetic simulations at 3T using a uniform phantom and a multitissue realistic head model with a generic DBS implant. Our strategy is based on using implant-friendly modes, which are defined as the modes of an array that reduce the local SAR around the DBS lead tip. These modes are used in a spokes pulse design algorithm in order to produce highly uniform magnitude least-squares flip angle excitations.RESULTS: Local SAR (1 g) at the lead tip is reduced below 0.1 W/kg compared with 31.2 W/kg, which is obtained by a simple quadrature birdcage excitation without any sort of SAR mitigation. For the multitissue realistic head model, peak 10 g local SAR and global SAR are obtained as 4.52 W/kg and 0.48 W/kg, respectively. A uniform axial flip angle is also obtained (NRMSE &amp;lt;3%).CONCLUSION: Parallel transmit arrays can be used to generate implant-friendly modes and to reduce SAR around DBS implants while constraining peak local SAR and global SAR and maximizing flip angle homogeneity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/j.neulet.2014.04.001 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Intra-epidermal electric stimulation (IES) is an alternative to laser stimulation for selective activation of cutaneous Aδ-fibers. IES is based on the fact that nociceptive fiber terminals are located in the epidermis, whereas receptors of other fibers end deep in the dermis. IES can selectively stimulate C-fibers if the electrode structure and stimulation parameters are carefully selected. However, stable selective stimulation of C-fibers using IES has proven difficult and cannot currently be used in clinical settings. The purpose of the present study was to determine if IES performed using a modified electrode reliably stimulates C-fibers. Magnetoencephalographic responses to IES to the foot were measured in seven healthy subjects. IES elicited somatosensory evoked fields in all subjects. The mean peak latency was 1,327 ± 116 ms in the opercular region contralateral to the stimulated side, 1,318 ± 90 ms in the opercular region ipsilateral to the stimulated side, and 1350 ± 139 ms in the primary somatosensory cortex. These results indicate that IES performed using the modified electrode can selectively stimulate C-fibers and may be a useful tool for pain research as well as clinical evaluation of peripheral small fiber function. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0443-13.2014 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neuronal activity in the deep layers of the macaque (Macaca mulatta) superior colliculus (SC) and the underlying reticular formation is correlated with the initiation and execution of arm movements (Werner, 1993). Although the correlation of this activity with EMGs of proximal arm muscles is as strong as in motor cortex (Werner et al., 1997a; Stuphorn et al., 1999), little is known about the influence of electrical microstimulation in the SC on the initiation and trajectories of arm movements. Our experiments on three macaque monkeys clearly show that arm movements can be elicited by electrical microstimulation in the deep layers of the lateral SC and underlying reticular formation. The most extensively trained monkey, M1, extended his arm toward the screen in front of him more or less stereotypically upon electrical SC stimulation. In two other monkeys, M2 and M3, a larger repertoire of arm movements were elicited, categorized into three movement types, and compared before (M3) and after (M2 and M3) training: twitch (56% vs. 62%), lift (6% vs. 5%), and extend (37% vs. 32%), respectively. Therefore, arm movements induced by electrical stimulation in the monkey SC represent a further component of the functional repertoire of the SC using its impact on motoneurons in the spinal cord, probably via premotor neurons in the brainstem, as well as on structures involved in executing more complex movements such as target-directed reaching. Therefore, the macaque SC could be involved directly in the initiation, execution, and amendment of arm and hand movements. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1097/YCT.0b013e318295e30f </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: Little is known regarding the safety of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in the presence of cranial metallic objects (cMO) such as medical devices or metallic foreign bodies. The presence of cMO raises 3 theoretical concerns toward the safety of ECT: (1) cMO may significantly alter the ECT-induced electric field distribution in the brain regarding field strength and focality, (2) vascular complications at the location of the cMO due to the ECT-induced hyperdynamic state may occur, and (3) possible development of a prolonged seizure/status epilepticus during ECT as a consequence of a device-induced symptomatic epilepsy. In the light of missing systematic approaches, we intended to assess the safety of ECT in the presence of cMO with particular regard to the concerns as specified previously.METHODS: A systematic review of previously published cases of ECT in patients with cMO was conducted.RESULTS: We identified 23 publications reporting 24 cases of ECT in the presence of cMO (cerebral clipping systems, 8 cases; cerebral coils, 2 cases; deep brain stimulator, 4 cases; osteosynthesis materials or other metallic medical devices, 7 cases; foreign bodies, 3 cases). Modified placement of ECT-electrodes was reported in 10 cases (42%). No ECT-related complications with regard to the proposed theoretical concerns were reported.CONCLUSIONS: The absence of cMO-related complications during ECT in the reported cases implies that cMO might not represent an absolute contraindication for the performance of ECT. However, the indication for ECT should be put in place thoroughly in patients with cMO. Further research is necessary for an adequate safety assessment. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS)/ Deep-brain Magnetic Stimulation (DMS) is an effective therapy for various neuropsychiatric disorders including major depression disorder. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the impacts of rTMS/DMS on the brain are not yet fully understood.RESULTS: Here we studied the effects of deep-brain magnetic stimulation to brain on the molecular and cellular level. We examined the adult hippocampal neurogenesis and hippocampal synaptic plasticity of rodent under stress conditions with deep-brain magnetic stimulation treatment. We found that DMS promotes adult hippocampal neurogenesis significantly and facilitates the development of adult new-born neurons. Remarkably, DMS exerts anti-depression effects in the learned helplessness mouse model and rescues hippocampal long-term plasticity impaired by restraint stress in rats. Moreover, DMS alleviates the stress response in a mouse model for Rett syndrome and prolongs the life span of these animals dramatically.CONCLUSIONS: Deep-brain magnetic stimulation greatly facilitates adult hippocampal neurogenesis and maturation, also alleviates depression and stress-related responses in animal models. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Research studies on transcranial electric stimulation, including direct current, often use a computational model to provide guidance on the placing of sponge-electrode pads. However, the expertise and computational resources needed for finite element modeling (FEM) make modeling impractical in a clinical setting. Our objective is to make the exploration of different electrode configurations accessible to practitioners. We provide an efficient tool to estimate current distributions for arbitrary pad configurations while obviating the need for complex simulation software.APPROACH: To efficiently estimate current distributions for arbitrary pad configurations we propose to simulate pads with an array of high-definition (HD) electrodes and use an efficient linear superposition to then quickly evaluate different electrode configurations.MAIN RESULTS: Numerical results on ten different pad configurations on a normal individual show that electric field intensity simulated with the sampled array deviates from the solutions with pads by only 5% and the locations of peak magnitude fields have a 94% overlap when using a dense array of 336 electrodes.SIGNIFICANCE: Computationally intensive FEM modeling of the HD array needs to be performed only once, perhaps on a set of standard heads that can be made available to multiple users. The present results confirm that by using these models one can now quickly and accurately explore and select pad-electrode montages to match a particular clinical need. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for movement disorders, but the fundamental mechanisms by which DBS has its effects remain unknown. Computational models can provide insights into the mechanisms of DBS, but to be useful, the models must have sufficient detail to predict accurately the electric fields produced by DBS. We used a finite-element method model of the Medtronic 3387 electrode array, coupled to cable models of myelinated axons, to quantify how interpolation errors, electrode geometry, and the electrode-tissue interface affect calculation of electrical potentials and stimulation thresholds for populations of model nerve fibers. Convergence of the potentials was not a sufficient criterion for ensuring the same degree of accuracy in subsequent determination of stimulation thresholds, because the accuracy of the stimulation thresholds depended on the order of the elements. Simplifying the 3387 electrode array by ignoring the inactive contacts and extending the terminated end of the shaft had position-dependent effects on the potentials and excitation thresholds, and these simplifications may impact correlations between DBS parameters and clinical outcomes. When the current density in the bulk tissue is uniform, the effect of the electrode-tissue interface impedance could be approximated by filtering the potentials calculated with a static lumped electrical equivalent circuit. Further, for typical DBS parameters during voltage-regulated stimulation, it was valid to approximate the electrode as an ideal polarized electrode with a nonlinear capacitance. Validation of these computational considerations enables accurate modeling of the electric field produced by DBS. </td>

Here, we investigated the projections from the three subnuclei of the medial geniculate body (MGB), namely, its ventral (MGv), dorsal (MGd), and medial (MGm) divisions, as well as from several of their subdivisions (MGv: pars lateralis [LV], pars ovoidea [OV], rostral pole [RP]; MGd: deep dorsal nucleus [DD]), to the auditory cortex (AC) by stereotaxic pressure injections and electrophysiologically guided iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tract tracer biocytin. Our data reveal highly specific features of the TC connections regarding their nuclear origin in the subdivisions of the MGB and their termination patterns in the auditory cortical fields and layers. In addition to tonotopically organized projections, primarily of the LV, OV, and DD to the AC, a large number of axons diverge across the tonotopic gradient. These originate mainly from the RP, MGd (proper), and MGm. In particular, neurons of the MGm project in a columnar fashion to several auditory fields, forming small- and medium-sized boutons, and also hitherto unknown giant terminals. The distinctive layer-specific distribution of axonal endings within the AC indicates that each of the TC connectivity systems has a specific function in auditory cortical processing. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson disease has been associated with psychiatric adverse effects including anxiety, depression, mania, psychosis, and suicide.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of deep brain stimulation in a large Parkinson disease clinical practice.METHODS: Patients approved for surgery by the Mayo Clinic deep brain stimulation clinical committee participated in a 6-month prospective naturalistic follow-up study. In addition to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, stability and psychiatric safety were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and Young Mania Rating scale. Outcomes were compared in patients with Parkinson disease who had a psychiatric history to those with no co-morbid psychiatric history.RESULTS: The study was completed by 49 of 54 patients. Statistically significant 6-month baseline to end-point improvement was found in motor and mood scales. No significant differences were found in psychiatric outcomes based on the presence or absence of psychiatric comorbidity.CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that patients with Parkinson disease who have a history of psychiatric co-morbidity can safely respond to deep brain stimulation with no greater risk of psychiatric adverse effect occurrence. A multidisciplinary team approach, including careful psychiatric screening ensuring mood stabilization and psychiatric follow-up, should be viewed as standard of care to optimize the psychiatric outcome in the course of deep brain stimulation treatment. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/j.brs.2013.10.007 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been proposed as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). H-coils, inducing deeper and wider magnetic fields compared to traditional coils, may be potentially useful in PD, characterized by widespread, bilateral involvement of cortico-subcortical circuits.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety of repetitive deep TMS (rDTMS) with H-coil as add-on treatment of motor symptoms in PD.METHODS: Twenty-seven PD patients (aged 60.1 ± 6.8 y; PD-duration: 6.3 ± 2.8 y; motor-UPDRS: 39.6 ± 10.1) underwent 12 rDTMS sessions over 4 weeks at excitatory (10 Hz) frequency over primary motor (M1) and bilateral prefrontal (PF) regions. Motor UPDRS off therapy was assessed before and after the last rDTMS session, together with safety records at each treatment session.RESULTS: No drop-outs or adverse events were recorded. Motor UPDRS significantly improved after rDTMS (10.8 points average reduction; P &amp;lt; 0.0001).CONCLUSIONS: High-frequency rDTMS might be a safe treatment for PD motor symptoms. Further placebo-controlled, randomized studies are warranted. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation is a clinical technique for the treatment of parkinson's disease based on the electric stimulation, through an implanted electrode, of specific basal ganglia in the brain. To identify the correct target of stimulation and to choose the optimal parameters for the stimulating signal, intraoperative microelectrodes are generally used. However, when they are replaced with the chronic macroelectrode, the effect of the stimulation is often very different. Here, we used numerical simulations to predict the stimulation of neuronal fibers induced by microelectrodes and macroelectrodes placed in different positions with respect to each other. Results indicate that comparable stimulations can be obtained if the chronic macroelectrode is correctly positioned with the same electric center of the intraoperative microelectrode. Otherwise, some groups of fibers may experience a completely different electric stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is preferred for imaging the central nervous system (CNS). An important hazard for neurostimulation patients is heating at the electrode interface induced, for example, by 64-MHz radiofrequency (RF) magnetic fields of a 1.5T scanner.OBJECTIVE: We performed studies to define the thermal dose (time and temperature) that would not cause symptomatic neurological injury.METHODS: Approaches included animal studies where leads with temperature probes were implanted in the brain or spine of sheep and exposed to RF-induced temperatures of 37 °C to 49 °C for 30 minutes. Histopathological examinations were performed 7 days after recovery. We also reviewed the threshold for RF lesions in the CNS, and for CNS injury from cancer hyperthermia. Cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 °C was used to normalize the data to exposure times and temperatures expected during MRI.RESULTS: Deep brain and spinal RF heating up to 43 °C for 30 minutes produced indistinguishable effects compared with 37 °C controls. Exposures greater than 43 °C for 30 minutes produced temperature-dependent, localized thermal damage. These results are consistent with limits on hyperthermia exposure to 41.8 °C for 60 minutes in patients who have cancer and with the reversibility of low-temperature and short-duration trial heating during RF lesion procedures.CONCLUSION: A safe temperature for induced lead heating is 43 °C for 30 minutes. MRI-related RF heating above 43 °C or longer than 30 minutes may be associated with increased risk of clinically evident thermal damage to neural structures immediately surrounding implanted leads. The establishment of a thermal dose limit is a first step toward making specific neurostimulation systems conditionally safe during MRI procedures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sleep-related headache and its management. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s11940-013-0258-1 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OPINION STATEMENT: Sleep and headache have both generated curiosity within the human mind for centuries. The relationship between headache and sleep disorders is very complex. While Lieving in 1873 first observed that headaches were linked to sleep, Dexter and Weitzman in 1970 described the relationship between headache and sleep stages. Though our understanding of sleep and headache relationship has improved over the years with expanding knowledge in both fields and assessment tools such as polysomnography, it is still poorly understood. Headache and sleep have an interdependent relationship. Headache may be intrinsically related to sleep (migraine with and without aura, cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania), may cause sleep disturbance (chronic migraine, chronic tension-type headache, and medication overuse headache) or a manifestation of a sleep disorder like obstructive sleep apnea. Headache and sleep disorder may be a common manifestation of systemic dysfunction-like anemia and hypoxemia. Headaches may occur during sleep, after sleep, and in relation to different sleep stages. Lack of sleep and excessive sleep are both considered triggers for migraine. Insomnia is more common among chronic headache patients. Experimental data suggest that there is a common anatomic and physiologic substrate. There is overwhelming evidence that cluster headache and hypnic headaches are chronobiological disorders with strong association with sleep and involvement of hypothalamus. Cluster headache shows a circadian and circannual rhythmicity while hypnic headache shows an alarm clock pattern. There is also a preferential occurrence of cluster headache, hypnic headache, and paroxysmal hemicrania during REM sleep. Silencing of anti-nociceptive network of periaqueductal grey (PAG), locus ceruleus and dorsal raphe nucleus doing REM sleep may explain the preferential pattern. Sleep related headaches can be classified into (1) headaches with high association with obstructive sleep apnea, which includes cluster headache, hypnic headache, and headache related to obstructive sleep apnea; and (2) headaches with high prevalence of insomnia, medication overuse, and psychiatric comorbidity including chronic migraine and chronic tension-type headache. The initial step in the management of sleep related headache is proper diagnosis with exclusion of secondary headaches. Screening for sleep disorders with the use of proper tests including polysomnography and referral to sleep clinic, when appropriate is very helpful. Control of individual episode in less than 2 hours should be the initial goal using measures to abort and prevent a relapse. Cluster headache responds very well to injectable Imitrex and oxygen. Verapamil, steroids and lithium are used for preventive treatment of cluster headache. Intractable cluster headache patients have responded to hypothalamic deep brain stimulation. Hypnic headache patients respond to nightly caffeine, indomethacin, and lithium. Paroxysmal hemicrania responds very well to indomethacin. Early morning headaches associated with obstructive sleep apnea respond to CPAP or BiPAP with complete resolution of headache within a month. Patient education and lifestyle modification play a significant role in overall success of the treatment. Chronic tension-type headache and chronic migraine have high prevalence of insomnia and comorbid psychiatric disorders, which require behavioral insomnia treatment and medication if needed along with psychiatric evaluation. Apart from the abortive treatment tailored to the headache types, - such as triptans and DHE 45 for migraine and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication for chronic tension-type headache, preventive treatment with different class of medications including antiepileptics (Topamax and Depakote), calcium channel blockers (verapamil), beta blockers (propranolol), antidepressants (amitriptyline), and Botox may be used depending upon the comorbid conditions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1111/ejn.12373 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Damage to cerebral systems is frequently followed by the emergence of compensatory mechanisms, which serve to reduce the effects of brain damage and allow recovery of function. Intrinsic recovery, however, is rarely complete. Non-invasive brain stimulation technologies have the potential to actively shape neural circuits and enhance recovery from brain damage. In this study, a stable deficit for detecting and orienting to visual stimuli presented in the contralesional visual hemifield was generated by producing unilateral brain damage of the right posterior parietal and contiguous visual cortical areas. A long regimen of inhibitory non-invasive transcranial direct-current stimulation (cathodal tDCS, 2 mA, 20 min) was applied to the contralateral (intact) posterior parietal cortex over 14 weeks (total of 70 sessions, one per day, 5 days per week) and behavioral outcomes were periodically assessed. In three out of four stimulated cats, lasting recovery of visuospatial function was observed. Recovery started after 2-3 weeks of stimulation, and recovered targets were located first in the periphery, and moved to more central visual field locations with the accrual of stimulation sessions. Recovery for moving tasks followed a biphasic pattern before reaching plateau levels. Recovery did not occur for more difficult visual tasks. These findings highlight the ability of multiple sessions of transcranial direct-current stimulation to produce recovery of visuospatial function after unilateral brain damage. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an effective clinical treatment for several medically refractory neurological disorders. However, even after decades of clinical success, explicit understanding of the response of neurons to applied electric fields remains limited, and scientific definition of the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS remains elusive. In addition, it is presently unclear which electrode designs and stimulation paradigms are optimal for maximal therapeutic benefit and minimal side-effects with DBS. Detailed computer modeling of DBS has emerged recently as a powerful technique to enhance our understanding of the effects of DBS and to create a virtual testing ground for new stimulation strategies. This chapter summarizes the fundamentals of neurostimulation modeling, presents some scientific contributions of computer models to the field of DBS, and demonstrates the application of DBS modeling tools to augment the clinical utility of DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This paper presents design and simulation of a circular meander dipole antenna at the industrial, scientific, and medical band of 915 MHz for energy scavenging in a passive head-mountable deep brain stimulation device. The interaction of the proposed antenna with a rat body is modeled and discussed. In the antenna, the radiating layer is meandered, and a FR-4 substrate is used to limit the radius and height of the antenna to 14 mm and 1.60 mm, respectively. The resonance frequency of the designed antenna is 915 MHz and the bandwidth of 15 MHz at a return loss of -10 dB in free space. To model the interaction of the antenna with a rat body, two aspects including functional and biological are considered. The functional aspect includes input impedance, resonance frequency, gain pattern, radiation efficiency of the antenna, and the biological aspect involves electric field distribution, and SAR value. A complete rat model is used in the finite difference time domain based EM simulation software XFdtd. The simulated results demonstrate that the specific absorption rate distributions occur within the skull in the rat model, and their values are higher than the standard regulated values for the antenna receiving power of 1W. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stimulation of deeper brain structures by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may be beneficial in the treatment of several neurological and psychiatric disorders. This paper presents numerical simulation of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) by considering double cone, H-and Halo coils. Three-dimensional distributions of the induced fields i.e. magnetic flux density, current density and electric fields in realistic head model by dTMS coils were calculated by impedance method and the results were compared with that of figure-of-eight coil. It was found that double cone and H-coils have significantly deep field penetration at the expense of induced higher and wider spread electrical fields in superficial cortical regions. The Halo coil working with a circular coil carrying currents in opposite directions provides a flexible way to stimulate deep brain structures with much lower stimulation in superficial brain tissues. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Over the last four decades, a range of different neuroimaging tools have been used to study human auditory attention, spanning from classic event-related potential studies using electroencephalography to modern multimodal imaging approaches (e.g., combining anatomical information based on magnetic resonance imaging with magneto- and electroencephalography). This review begins by exploring the different strengths and limitations inherent to different neuroimaging methods, and then outlines some common behavioral paradigms that have been adopted to study auditory attention. We argue that in order to design a neuroimaging experiment that produces interpretable, unambiguous results, the experimenter must not only have a deep appreciation of the imaging technique employed, but also a sophisticated understanding of perception and behavior. Only with the proper caveats in mind can one begin to infer how the cortex supports a human in solving the &amp;quot;cocktail party&amp;quot; problem.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electrical neurostimulation techniques, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), are increasingly used in the neurosciences, e.g., for studying brain function, and for neurotherapeutics, e.g., for treating depression, epilepsy, and Parkinson's disease. The characterization of electrical properties of brain tissue has guided our fundamental understanding and application of these methods, from electrophysiologic theory to clinical dosing-metrics. Nonetheless, prior computational models have primarily relied on ex-vivo impedance measurements. We recorded the in-vivo impedances of brain tissues during neurosurgical procedures and used these results to construct MRI guided computational models of TMS and DBS neurostimulatory fields and conductance-based models of neurons exposed to stimulation. We demonstrated that tissues carry neurostimulation currents through frequency dependent resistive and capacitive properties not typically accounted for by past neurostimulation modeling work. We show that these fundamental brain tissue properties can have significant effects on the neurostimulatory-fields (capacitive and resistive current composition and spatial/temporal dynamics) and neural responses (stimulation threshold, ionic currents, and membrane dynamics). These findings highlight the importance of tissue impedance properties on neurostimulation and impact our understanding of the biological mechanisms and technological potential of neurostimulatory methods. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s00701-013-1782-1 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: The dorso-lateral part of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is considered as the usual target of deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease. Nevertheless, the exact anatomical location of the electrode contacts used for chronic stimulation is still a matter of debate. The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review of the existing literature on this issue.METHOD: We searched for studies on the anatomical location of active contacts published until December 2012.RESULTS: We identified 13 studies, published between 2002 and 2010, including 260 patients and 466 electrodes. One hundred and sixty-four active contacts (35 %) were identified within the STN, 117 (25 %) at the interface between STN and the surrounding structures, 184 (40 %) above the STN and one within the substantia nigra. We observed great discrepancies between the different series. The contra-lateral improvement was between 37 and 78.5 % for contacts located within the STN, between 48.6 and 73 % outside the STN, between 65.3 and 66 % at the interface. The authors report no clear correlation between anatomical location and stimulation parameters.CONCLUSIONS: Post-operative analysis of the anatomical location of active contacts is difficult, and all the methods used are debatable. The relationship between the anatomical location of active contacts and the clinical effectiveness of stimulation is unclear. It would be necessary to take into account the volume of the electrode contacts and the diffusion of the stimulation. We can nevertheless assume that the interface between dorso-lateral STN, zona incerta and Forel's fields could be directly involved in the effects of stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/TBME.2013.2264632 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a tool for noninvasive stimulation of neuronal tissue used for research in cognitive neuroscience and to treat neurological disorders. Many TMS applications call for large electric fields to be sharply focused on regions that often lie deep inside the brain. Unfortunately, the fields generated by present-day TMS coils diffuse and decay rapidly as they penetrate into the head. As a result, they tend to stimulate relatively large regions of tissue near the brain surface. Earlier studies suggested that a focused TMS excitation can be attained using multiple nonuniformly fed coils in a multichannel array. We propose a systematic, genetic algorithm-based technique for synthesizing multichannel arrays that minimize the volume of the excited region required to achieve a prescribed penetration depth and maintain realistic values for the input driving currents. Because multichannel arrays are costly to build, we also propose a method to convert the multichannel arrays into single-channel ones while minimally materially deteriorating performance. Numerical results show that the new multi- and single-channel arrays stimulate tissue 2.4 cm into the head while exciting 3.0 and 2.6 times less volume than conventional Figure-8 coils, respectively. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neuroplasticity can be defined as a final common pathway of neurobiological processes, including structural, functional or molecular mechanisms, that result in stability or compensation for age- or disease-related changes. The papers in this issue address the aging process, as well as depression, dementia, and stroke and a range of interventions, including manipulations in behavior (physical and cognitive activity/exercise), physiological factors (caloric restriction, cholesterol), pharmacologic treatments (AMPA receptors) and manipulation of brain magnetic fields and electrical activity (transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy, and deep brain stimulation).This editorial will address different facets of neuroplasticity, the need for translational research to interpret neuroimaging data thought to reflect neuroplasticity in the human brain, and the next steps for testing interventions in aging and in disease. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: We present a computational method that implements a reduced set of Maxwell's equations to allow simulation of cells under realistic conditions: sub-micron cell morphology, a conductive non-homogeneous space and various ion channel properties and distributions.APPROACH: While a reduced set of Maxwell's equations can be used to couple membrane currents to extra- and intracellular potentials, this approach is rarely taken, most likely because adequate computational tools are missing. By using these equations, and introducing an implicit solver, numerical stability is attained even with large time steps. The time steps are limited only by the time development of the membrane potentials.MAIN RESULTS: This method allows simulation times of tens of minutes instead of weeks, even for complex problems. The extracellular fields are accurately represented, including secondary fields, which originate at inhomogeneities of the extracellular space and can reach several millivolts. We present a set of instructive examples that show how this method can be used to obtain reference solutions for problems, which might not be accurately captured by the traditional approaches. This includes the simulation of realistic magnitudes of extracellular action potential signals in restricted extracellular space.SIGNIFICANCE: The electric activity of neurons creates extracellular potentials. Recent findings show that these endogenous fields act back onto the neurons, contributing to the synchronization of population activity. The influence of endogenous fields is also relevant for understanding therapeutic approaches such as transcranial direct current, transcranial magnetic and deep brain stimulation. The mutual interaction between fields and membrane currents is not captured by today's concepts of cellular electrophysiology, including the commonly used activation function, as those concepts are based on isolated membranes in an infinite, isopotential extracellular space. The presented tool makes simulations with detailed morphology and implicit interactions of currents and fields available to the electrophysiology community. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The identification of a hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic nucleus connection highlighted the important role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in regulating behavior. However, this pathway was shown primarily from motor areas. Hyperdirect pathways associated with cognitive and motivational cortical regions are particularly relevant given recent data from deep brain stimulation, both for neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Our experiments were designed to demonstrate the existence and organization of prefrontal-STN projections, help delineate the &amp;quot;limbic&amp;quot; STN, and determine whether convergence between cortico-STN fibers from functionally diverse cortical areas exists in the STN. We injected anterograde tracers in the ventromedial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, anterior cingulate, and dorsal prefrontal cortices of Macaca nemestrina and Macaca fascicularis to analyze the organization of terminals and passing fibers in the STN. Results show a topographically organized prefrontal hyperdirect pathway in primates. Limbic areas project to the medial tip of the nucleus, straddling its border and extending into the lateral hypothalamus. Associative areas project to the medial half, motor areas to the lateral half. Limbic projections terminated primarily rostrally and motor projections more caudally. The extension of limbic projections into the lateral hypothalamus, suggests that this region be included in the STN. A high degree of convergence exists between projections from functionally diverse cortical areas, creating potentially important interfaces between terminal fields. Taken together, the results provide an anatomical substrate to extend the role of the hyperdirect pathway in models of basal ganglia function, and new keys for understanding deep brain stimulation effects on cognitive and motivational aspects of behavior. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The similarity of the proportions of different types of experiences reported during surgical electrical stimulation of epileptic temporal lobes published in the scientific literature and those reported following exposures to weak, applied magnetic fields was supported by direct comparisons in a retrospective analysis. Of the 20 types of specific experiences, the surgical stimulation groups reported proportionally more fear experiences, while the groups exposed to temporally patterned magnetic fields applied across the temporoparietal regions reported more somesthetic and vestibular experiences. There were no group differences for the other 17 types of experiences. Calculations indicated that the spread of charge displacement from neuronal membranes by the currents employed in the surgical studies and the magnetic field energy associated with the applied fields could affect similar numbers of cortical neurons. The similar subjective experiences of the two techniques indicate that the less invasive procedures might be employed to systematically study complex partial seizures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Thalamotomy was formerly used to treat different tremor syndromes. Nowadays, deep brain stimulation has become an established technique to treat -different movement disorders. The combination of these two stereotactic interventions is rare.CLINICAL PRESENTATION: We present a patient in which a right-sided tremor -syndrome with an underlying pathology of combined essential tremor and Parkinsonian tremor was successfully treated initially with a left-sided thalamotomy and subsequently with -bilateral deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus.RESULTS: Deep brain stimulation in the subthalamic nucleus resulted in hemidystonia, pathological laughing and crying, dysarthria and dysphagia, all due to dislocation of the stimulation electrodes contacting the internal capsule. After discontinuation of the high-frequency stimulation these side-effects disappeared, but were then reactivated by an LCD television in stand-by mode.CONCLUSION: In this report we discuss the pathophysiology of pseudobulbar symptoms and pathological laughing and crying in context of thalamotomy and dislocated DBS electrodes. Furthermore, we report on the occurrence that magnetic fields in the household have an impact on deep brain stimulation, even if they are in stand-by mode. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) involves the delivery of precise electrical signals to specific deep anatomical structures of the central nervous system, with the objective of altering or modulating neural functioning and achieving a reversible, adjustable and therapeutic or clinically beneficial effect. The exact mechanism of action of DBS is still the subject of ongoing investigations. However, based on extensive clinical investigations, it has become an established modality for the surgical treatment of advanced and medication intractable movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and dystonia. DBS is also being investigated for conditions such as intractable epilepsy, neurobehavioral and psychiatric disorders such as treatment resistant depression, obsessive compulsive disorders, addiction, obesity, Alzheimer's disease and traumatic brain injury. The advantage of DBS over older deep brain lesioning procedures is its reversibility and adjustability. The design of the DBS systems allows for dynamic adjustment of the effects of electrical stimulation by altering the contacts at which electrical pulses are delivered to the brain and changing the stimulation parameters of those pulses. The clinical results from studies on DBS show that it has great potential making it one of most promising fields which could be used to address challenging neurological problems. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: To present preliminary, in vivo temperature measurements during MRI of a pig implanted with a deep brain stimulation (DBS) system.MATERIALS AND METHODS: DBS system (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was implanted in the brain of an anesthetized pig. 3.0-T MRI was performed with a T/R head coil using the low-SAR GRE EPI and IR-prepped GRE sequences (SAR: 0.42 and 0.39 W/kg, respectively), and the high-SAR 4-echo RF spin echo (SAR: 2.9 W/kg). Fluoroptic thermometry was used to directly measure RF-related heating at the DBS electrodes, and at the implantable pulse generator (IPG). For reference the measurements were repeated in the same pig at 1.5 T and, at both field strengths, in a phantom.RESULTS: At 3.0T, the maximal temperature elevations at DBS electrodes were 0.46 °C and 2.3 °C, for the low- and high-SAR sequences, respectively. No heating was observed on the implanted IPG during any of the measurements. Measurements of in vivo heating differed from those obtained in the phantom.CONCLUSION: The 3.0-T MRI using GRE EPI and IR-prepped GRE sequences resulted in local temperature elevations at DBS electrodes of no more than 0.46 °C. Although no extrapolation should be made to human exams and much further study will be needed, these preliminary data are encouraging for the future use 3.0-T MRI in patients with DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> As neuromodulation therapy has grown, so has the recognition that computational models can provide important insights into the design, operation, and clinical application of neurostimulation systems. Models of deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation have advanced over recent decades from simple, stereotyped models to sophisticated patient-specific models that can incorporate many important details of the stimulation system and the attributes of individual subjects. Models have been used to make detailed predictions of the bioelectric fields produced during stimulation. These predictions have been used as a starting point for further analyses such as stimulation safety, neural response, neurostimulation system design, or clinical outcomes. This chapter provides a review of recent advances and anticipated future directions in computational modeling of neuromodulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain activation during transcranial electrical stimulation is used to provide insight into the mechanisms of neuromodulation and targeting of particular brain structures. However, the passage of current through the body may interfere with the concurrent detection of blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal, which is sensitive to local magnetic fields. To test whether these currents can affect concurrent fMRI recordings we performed conventional gradient echo-planar imaging (EPI) during transcranial direct current (tDCS) and alternating current stimulation (tACS) on two post-mortem subjects. tDCS induced signals in both superficial and deep structures. The signal was specific to the electrode montage, with the strongest signal near cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and scalp. The direction of change relative to non-stimulation reversed with tDCS stimulation polarity. For tACS there was no net effect of the MRI signal. High-resolution individualized modeling of current flow and induced static magnetic fields suggested a strong coincidence of the change EPI signal with regions of large current density and magnetic fields. These initial results indicate that (1) fMRI studies of tDCS must consider this potentially confounding interference from current flow and (2) conventional MRI imaging protocols can be potentially used to measure current flow during transcranial electrical stimulation. The optimization of current measurement and artifact correction techniques, including consideration of the underlying physics, remains to be addressed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Short circuit in deep brain stimulation. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3171/2012.8.JNS112073 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECT: The authors undertook this study to investigate the incidence, cause, and clinical influence of short circuits in patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS).METHODS: After the incidental identification of a short circuit during routine follow-up, the authors initiated a policy at their institution of routinely evaluating both therapeutic impedance and system impendence at every outpatient DBS follow-up visit, irrespective of the presence of symptoms suggesting possible system malfunction. This study represents a report of their findings after 1 year of this policy.RESULTS: Implanted DBS leads exhibiting short circuits were identified in 7 patients (8.9% of the patients seen for outpatient follow-up examinations during the 12-month study period). The mean duration from DBS lead implantation to the discovery of the short circuit was 64.7 months. The symptoms revealing short circuits included the wearing off of therapeutic effect, apraxia of eyelid opening, or dysarthria in 6 patients with Parkinson disease (PD), and dystonia deterioration in 1 patient with generalized dystonia. All DBS leads with short circuits had been anchored to the cranium using titanium miniplates. Altering electrode settings resulted in clinical improvement in the 2 PD cases in which patients had specific symptoms of short circuits (2.5%) but not in the other 4 cases. The patient with dystonia underwent repositioning and replacement of a lead because the previous lead was located too anteriorly, but did not experience symptom improvement.CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the sudden loss of clinical efficacy of DBS caused by an open circuit, short circuits may arise due to a gradual decrease in impedance, causing the insidious development of neurological symptoms via limited or extended potential fields as well as shortened battery longevity. The incidence of short circuits in DBS may be higher than previously thought, especially in cases in which DBS leads are anchored with miniplates. The circuit impedance of DBS should be routinely checked, even after a long history of DBS therapy, especially in cases of miniplate anchoring. </td>

The new technology provides a unique way to couple electric signals in the neural network to the magnetic dipoles in the nanoparticles with the purpose to enable a non-invasive approach. Simulations of the effect of ME nanoparticles for non-invasively stimulating the brain of a patient with Parkinson's Disease to bring the pulsed sequences of the electric field to the levels comparable to those of healthy people show that the optimized values for the concentration of the 20-nm nanoparticles (with the magneto-electric (ME) coefficient of 100 V cm(-1) Oe(-1) in the aqueous solution) is 3 × 10(6) particles/cc, and the frequency of the externally applied 300-Oe magnetic field is 80 Hz. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dystonia has generally been considered a basal ganglia (BG) disorder. Early models hypothesized that dystonia occurred as the result of reduced mean discharge rates in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi). Increasing evidence suggests a more systemwide disruption of the basal ganglia thalamic circuit (BGTC) resulting in altered firing patterns, synchronized oscillations, and widened receptive fields. A model of dystonia incorporating these changes within the BGTC is presented in which we postulate that this pathophysiology arises from disruptions within the striatum. Alterations in the cerebellothalamocortical (CBTC) pathway to the development of dystonia may also play a role. However, the contribution of CBTC abnormalities to dystonia remains unclear and may vary with different etiologies of dystonia. Finally, the relevance of established and emerging theories related to the pathophysiology of dystonia is addressed within the context of improving conventional approaches for deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment strategies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> An implantable micromachined neural probe with multichannel electrode arrays for both neural signal recording and electrical stimulation was designed, simulated and experimentally validated for deep brain stimulation (DBS) applications. The developed probe has a rough three-dimensional microstructure on the electrode surface to maximize the electrode-tissue contact area. The flexible, polyimide-based microelectrode arrays were each composed of a long shaft (14.9 mm in length) and 16 electrodes (5 µm thick and with a diameter of 16 µm). The ability of these arrays to record and stimulate specific areas in a rat brain was evaluated. Moreover, we have developed a finite element model (FEM) applied to an electric field to evaluate the volume of tissue activated (VTA) by DBS as a function of the stimulation parameters. The signal-to-noise ratio ranged from 4.4 to 5 over a 50 day recording period, indicating that the laboratory-designed neural probe is reliable and may be used successfully for long-term recordings. The somatosensory evoked potential (SSEP) obtained by thalamic stimulations and in vivo electrode-electrolyte interface impedance measurements was stable for 50 days and demonstrated that the neural probe is feasible for long-term stimulation. A strongly linear (positive correlation) relationship was observed among the simulated VTA, the absolute value of the SSEP during the 200 ms post-stimulus period (ΣSSEP) and c-Fos expression, indicating that the simulated VTA has perfect sensitivity to predict the evoked responses (c-Fos expression). This laboratory-designed neural probe and its FEM simulation represent a simple, functionally effective technique for studying DBS and neural recordings in animal models. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.10070109 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a novel and effective surgical intervention for refractory Parkinson's disease (PD). The authors review the current literature to identify the clinical correlates associated with subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS-induced hypomania/mania in PD patients. Ventromedial electrode placement has been most consistently implicated in the induction of STN DBS-induced mania. There is some evidence of symptom amelioration when electrode placement is switched to a more dorsolateral contact. Additional clinical correlates may include unipolar stimulation, higher voltage (&amp;amp;gt;3 V), male sex, and/or early-onset PD. STN DBS-induced psychiatric adverse events emphasize the need for comprehensive psychiatric presurgical evaluation and follow-up in PD patients. Animal studies and prospective clinical research, combined with advanced neuroimaging techniques, are needed to identify clinical correlates and underlying neurobiological mechanisms of STN DBS-induced mania. Such working models would serve to further our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of mania and contribute valuable new insight toward development of future DBS mood-stabilization therapies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2012.03.015 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Traditionally functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been used to map activity in the human brain by measuring increases in the Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) signal. Often accompanying positive BOLD fMRI signal changes are sustained negative signal changes. Previous studies investigating the neurovascular coupling mechanisms of the negative BOLD phenomenon have used concurrent 2D-optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) and electrophysiology (Boorman et al., 2010). These experiments suggested that the negative BOLD signal in response to whisker stimulation was a result of an increase in deoxy-haemoglobin and reduced multi-unit activity in the deep cortical layers. However, Boorman et al. (2010) did not measure the BOLD and haemodynamic response concurrently and so could not quantitatively compare either the spatial maps or the 2D-OIS and fMRI time series directly. Furthermore their study utilised a homogeneous tissue model in which is predominantly sensitive to haemodynamic changes in more superficial layers. Here we test whether the 2D-OIS technique is appropriate for studies of negative BOLD. We used concurrent fMRI with 2D-OIS techniques for the investigation of the haemodynamics underlying the negative BOLD at 7 Tesla. We investigated whether optical methods could be used to accurately map and measure the negative BOLD phenomenon by using 2D-OIS haemodynamic data to derive predictions from a biophysical model of BOLD signal changes. We showed that despite the deep cortical origin of the negative BOLD response, if an appropriate heterogeneous tissue model is used in the spectroscopic analysis then 2D-OIS can be used to investigate the negative BOLD phenomenon. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Using electrical stimulation to the deep, most caudal part of the right frontal eye field (FEF), we demonstrate a novel pattern of vertical (upward) eye movement that was previously only thought possible by stimulating both frontal eye fields simultaneously. If stimulation was started when the subject looked laterally, the initial eye movement was back to the midline, followed by upward deviation. Our finding challenges current view of topological organisation in the human FEF and may have general implications for concepts of topological organisation of the motor cortex, since sustained stimulation also induced upward head movements as a component of the vertical gaze shift.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The neurosurgical method of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is used to treat symptoms of movement disorders like Parkinson's disease by implanting stimulation electrodes in deep brain areas. The aim of this study was to examine the field distribution in DBS and the role of heterogeneous and anisotropic material properties in the brain areas where stimulation is applied. Finite element models of the human brain were developed comprising tissue heterogeneity and anisotropy. The tissue data were derived from averaged magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging datasets. Unilateral stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) was computed using an accurate model of an electrode used in clinical treatment of DBS extended with an encapsulation layer around the electrode body. Computations of anisotropic and isotropic brain models, which consider resistive tissue properties for unipolar and bipolar electrode configurations, were carried out. Electrode position was varied within an area around the stimulation center. Results have shown a deviation of 2% between anisotropic and isotropic field distributions in the vicinity of the STN. The sensitivity of this deviation referring to the electrode position remained small, but increased when the electrode position approached areas of high anisotropy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a non-destructive, adjustable, and mainly reversible method of continuously giving electrical impulses into a small area of the brain via implanted electrodes. It has been established as a standard form of treatment for specific cases of Parkinson's disease, essential tremor and dystonia. It is currently being evaluated for several mental disorders, dementia and even alcoholism. In spite of its growing practical importance, the legal issues have so far undergone almost no analysis. The article outlines both the essential legal questions of DBS from the perspective of German Law as well as major issues of the current ethical debate, and the correlation of both fields. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The aim was to quantify the influence of heterogeneous isotropic and heterogeneous anisotropic tissue on the spatial distribution of the electric field during deep brain stimulation (DBS). Three finite element tissue models were created of one patient treated with DBS. Tissue conductivity was modelled as (I) homogeneous isotropic, (II) heterogeneous isotropic based on MRI, and (III) heterogeneous anisotropic based on diffusion tensor MRI. Modelled DBS electrodes were positioned in the subthalamic area, the pallidum, and the internal capsule in each tissue model. Electric fields generated during DBS were simulated for each model and target-combination and visualized with isolevels at 0.20 (inner), and 0.05 V mm(-1) (outer). Statistical and vector analysis was used for evaluation of the distribution of the electric field. Heterogeneous isotropic tissue altered the spatial distribution of the electric field by up to 4% at inner, and up to 10% at outer isolevel. Heterogeneous anisotropic tissue influenced the distribution of the electric field by up to 18 and 15% at each isolevel, respectively. The influence of heterogeneous and anisotropic tissue on the electric field may be clinically relevant in anatomic regions that are functionally subdivided and surrounded by multiple fibres of passage. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neuromodulation is one of the fastest growing fields in neurosurgery, as reflected by the growing interest in the use of electrical brain stimulation (EBS) to treat drug-resistant epilepsy, pain, and movement disorders. Hippocampal stimulation should be regarded as an experimental therapy for epilepsy, and patients considered for this intervention should do so in the context of a well-designed randomized controlled trial. Only well-conducted, blinded, randomized trials, followed by long-term systematic observation will yield a clear picture of the effect of this promising therapy, and will help guide its future use. This article provides a critical review of the best available evidence on hippocampal stimulation for epilepsy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s00115-011-3309-4 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS), which is already established as an effective treatment for movement disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, is increasingly being considered as a therapy option for mental diseases. Due to the increasing number of successful applications of DBS for otherwise therapy-resistant psychiatric diseases, DBS is becoming more and more of interest in fields of fundamental research as well as clinical care. However, the stimulation system is a medical product which has to be neurosurgically implanted and this fact is often used to draw certain analogies to earlier psychosurgical approaches in the era of Freeman. But, looking at the historical development of DBS, as is the aim of the present systematic and literature-based overview, it becomes obvious that DBS did not arise exclusively from the inglorious period of psychosurgery. In fact, two partly in parallel evolving lines of medical progress have contributed to the development of DBS as it is applied today. One of these lines is the use of lesional neurosurgical procedures, such as incision of capsules and cingulotomy, which in contrast to psychosurgical interventions in the era of Freeman, is aimed at subcortical structures and provides important basic knowledge for the choice of target points. In addition DBS is rooted in the application of an electrical charge with the goal to stimulate neuronal networks. </td>

Essential tremor and Parkinson tremor are most common and are also the most thoroughly studied. Major progress has occurred in the clinical semiology, neuroimaging, epidemiology, and pathophysiology of tremors. Pathology and genetic research are rapidly growing fields of study. Recently described tremor entities include orthostatic tremor, dystonic tremor, cortical tremor, and thalamic tremor. Treatment research methodology has improved substantially, but few double-blind controlled trials have been published. Deep brain stimulation is the most effective treatment for most tremors but is reserved for advanced cases. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> For a long time, in a localizationist view of brain functioning, a combination of symptoms called &amp;quot;frontal syndrome&amp;quot; has been interpreted as the direct result of damages involving the frontal lobe(s). The goal of this review is to challenge this view, that is, to move to a hodotopical approach to lesion mapping, on the basis of new insights provided by intraoperative electrostimulation mapping investigations in patients who underwent awake surgery for cerebral tumors. These original data reported in the last decade break with the traditional dogma of a modular and fixed organization of the central nervous system, by switching to the concepts of cerebral connectivity and plasticity - i.e., a brain organization based on dynamic interrelationships between parallel distributed networks. According to this revisited model, &amp;quot;frontal symptoms&amp;quot; can be generated by tumor or electrostimulation not only of the frontal lobes, but also of cortical and subcortical (white matter pathways/deep gray nuclei) structures outside the frontal lobes: especially, stimulation of the superior longitudinal fascicle may elicit speech production disorders, syntactic disturbances, involuntary language switching or phonemic paraphasia (arcuate fascicle), stimulation of the inferior fronto-occipital fascicle can generate semantic paraphasia or deficit of cross-modal judgment, stimulation of the subcallosal fasciculus may elicit transcortical motor aphasia, while stimulation of the striatum induces preservations. On the other hand, it is also possible to perform extensive right or left frontal lobectomy in patients who continue to have a normal familial, social and professional life, without &amp;quot;frontal syndrome&amp;quot;. Therefore, this provocative approach may open the door to a renewal in the modeling of brain processing as well as in its clinical applications, especially in the fields of cerebral surgery and functional rehabilitation. These findings illustrate well the need to reinforce links between cognitive neuroscience and clinical neurology/neurosurgery. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1159/000327045 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The superior colliculus (SC) in the mammalian mesencephalon is involved in avoidance or escape behaviors, but little is known about the response properties of collicular neurons to an object approaching on a collision course towards the animal. The present study identified two classes of looming-sensitive neurons, rho and eta cells, in the SC of the cat, but did not find any tau cell, which has been observed in the pigeon tectofugal pathway. The looming responses were characterized by distinct firing patterns, in which the neuronal discharge steadily increased as the object was approaching, and peaked approximately at the time of collision (rho cell) or some time earlier (eta cell). The response onset time of both rho and eta cells was linearly related to the square root of the diameter/velocity ratio of looming objects; whereas for eta cells, the response peak time was linearly related to the diameter/velocity ratio. The receptive fields of these collicular cells were composed of an excitatory center and a suppressive surround, but the occurrence and development of neuronal responses to looming stimuli were independent of the receptive-field organization. Although the cell number was relatively small in the deep layers of the SC, the proportion of looming-sensitive neurons was close to that in the superficial layers. These results suggest that a population of collicular cells is involved in signaling impending collision of a looming object with the animal and the neural mechanisms underlying the collision avoidance behaviors are to some extent conservative across species from insects to mammals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> INTRODUCTION: Non-invasive brain stimulation methods such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) are starting to be widely used to make causality-based inferences about brain-behavior interactions. Moreover, TMS-based clinical applications are under development to treat specific neurological or psychiatric conditions, such as depression, dystonia, pain, tinnitus and the sequels of stroke, among others.BACKGROUND: TMS works by inducing non-invasively electric currents in localized cortical regions thus modulating their activity levels according to settings, such as frequency, number of pulses, train and regime duration and intertrain intervals. For instance, it is known for the motor cortex that low frequency or continuous patterns of TMS pulses tend to depress local activity whereas high frequency and discontinuous TMS patterns tend to enhance it. Additionally, local cortical effects of TMS can result in dramatic patterns in distant brain regions. These distant effects are mediated via anatomical connectivity in a magnitude that depends on the efficiency and sign of such connections.PERSPECTIVES: An efficient use of TMS in both fields requires however, a deep understanding of its operational principles, its risks, its potential and limitations. In this article, we will briefly present the principles through which non-invasive brain stimulation methods, and in particular TMS, operate.CONCLUSION: Readers will be provided with fundamental information needed to critically discuss TMS studies and design hypothesis-driven TMS applications for cognitive and clinical neuroscience research. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: Deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) is an emerging and promising treatment for major depression. In our study, we explored the effectiveness of a second antidepressant course of deep TMS in major depression. We enrolled eight patients who had previously responded well to DTMS but relapsed within 1 year in order to evaluate whether a second course of DTMS would still be effective.METHODS: Eight depressive patients who relapsed after a previous successful deep TMS course expressed their wish to be treated again. Upon their request, they were recruited and treated with 20 daily sessions of DTMS at 20 Hz using the Brainsway's H1 coil. The Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS), Hamilton anxiety rating scale (HARS) and the Beck depression inventory (BDI) were used weekly to evaluate the response to treatment.RESULTS: Similar to the results obtained in the first course of treatment, the second course of treatment (after relapse) induced significant reductions in HDRS, HARS and BDI scores, compared to the ratings measured prior to treatment. The magnitude of response in the second course was smaller relative to that obtained in the first course of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that depressive patients who previously responded well to deep TMS treatment are likely to respond again. However, the slight reduction in the magnitude of the response in the second treatment raises the question of whether tolerance or resistance to this treatment may eventually develop. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1371/journal.pone.0016905 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Previously the application of a weak electric anodal current oscillating with a frequency of the sleep slow oscillation (∼0.75 Hz) during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NonREM) sleep boosted endogenous slow oscillation activity and enhanced sleep-associated memory consolidation. The slow oscillations occurring during NonREM sleep and theta oscillations present during REM sleep have been considered of critical relevance for memory formation. Here transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) oscillating at 5 Hz, i.e., within the theta frequency range (theta-tDCS) is applied during NonREM and REM sleep. Theta-tDCS during NonREM sleep produced a global decrease in slow oscillatory activity conjoint with a local reduction of frontal slow EEG spindle power (8-12 Hz) and a decrement in consolidation of declarative memory, underlining the relevance of these cortical oscillations for sleep-dependent memory consolidation. In contrast, during REM sleep theta-tDCS appears to increase global gamma (25-45 Hz) activity, indicating a clear brain state-dependency of theta-tDCS. More generally, results demonstrate the suitability of oscillating-tDCS as a tool to analyze functions of endogenous EEG rhythms and underlying endogenous electric fields as well as the interactions between EEG rhythms of different frequencies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although there exist some reference and stereotactic anatomical human brain atlases, there is no equivalent cerebrovascular atlas. A 3D reference atlas of the human cerebrovasculature that is interactive, stereotactic, very detailed, completely parcellated, fully labeled, extendable, dissectible, deformable, and user friendly, is needed in education, training, research, and clinical applications. We constructed a sophisticated and very detailed cerebrovascular atlas with 1325 vascular segments, the smallest of 80 μm in diameter. The atlas was created from multiple 3 and 7T scans by employing tools and methods developed in our lab. In contrast to a sort of &amp;quot;sampled&amp;quot; vascular geometry cited in the literature, we provide information about the &amp;quot;continuous&amp;quot; geometry of the vascular model measurable in 3D at every location and along any vascular segment for both hemispheres. This cerebrovascular atlas was validated taking into account domain knowledge from various fields including angiography, neurosurgery, neuroradiology, (clinical) neuroanatomy, and terminology. Validation was considered as a confirmation of the created vascular model to a typical (conventional) cerebrovascular system with nearly average dimensions. It was done in terms of vessel subdivision, origin, course, surrounding anatomy, patterns, length, diameter, and branches. This validation demonstrates that the constructed cerebrovascular model generally represents a normal, typical cerebrovasculature with its dimensions close to average. This 7T atlas along with the vascular model is a rich source of knowledge about the human cerebrovasculature. The atlas is applicable in education, research, and clinical applications; it has already been applied in deep brain stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neurological disorders are becoming increasingly common in developed countries as a result of the aging population. In spite of medications, these disorders can result in progressive loss of function as well as chronic physical, cognitive, and emotional disability that ultimately places enormous emotional and economic on the patient, caretakers, and the society in general. Neuromodulation is emerging as a therapeutic option in these patients. Neuromodulation is a field, which involves implantable devices that allow for the reversible adjustable application of electrical, chemical, or biological agents to the central or peripheral nervous system with the objective of altering its functioning with the objective of achieving a therapeutic or clinically beneficial effect. It is a rapidly evolving field that brings together many different specialties in the fields of medicine, materials science, computer science and technology, biomedical, and neural engineering as well as the surgical or interventional specialties. It has multiple current and emerging indications, and an enormous potential for growth. The main challenges before it are in the need for effective collaboration between engineers, basic scientists, and clinicians to develop innovations that address specific problems resulting in new devices and clinical applications. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Major depression (MD) might be conceptualized as pathological under-arousal of positive affective systems as parts of a network of brain regions assessing, reconciling and storing emotional stimuli versus an over-arousal of parts of the same network promoting separation-distress/GRIEF. In this context depression can be explained as an emotional pain state that is the result of a disregulation of several sub-systems that under physiological conditions are concerned with bodily or emotional homeostasis of the human organism in a social context. Physiologically, homeostasis is maintained by influences of the SEEKING system represented - amongst others - by the medial forebrain bundle (MFB). Neuroimaging studies show that the MFB has a proven access to the GRIEF/Sadness system. A functional decoupling of these systems with a dysfunctional GRIEF pathway might result in MD. Therewith GRIEF and SEEKING/PLEASURE systems play important roles as opponents in maintenance of emotional homeostasis. Chronic electrical modulation of the reward SEEKING pathways with deep brain stimulation might show anti-depressive effects in humans suffering from MD by re-initiating an emotional equilibrium (of higher or lower activity) between these opposing systems. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy relies on electrical stimulation of neuronal elements in small brain targets. However, the lack of fine spatial control over field distributions in current systems implies that stimulation easily spreads into adjacent structures that may induce adverse side-effects. This study investigates DBS field steering using a novel DBS lead design carrying a high-resolution electrode array. We apply computational models to simulate voltage distributions and DBS activation volumes in order to theoretically assess the potential of field steering in DBS. Our computational analysis demonstrates that the DBS-array is capable of accurately displacing activation volumes with sub-millimeter precision. Our findings demonstrate that future systems for DBS therapy may provide for more accurate target coverage than currently available systems achieve. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1109/IEMBS.2010.5626517 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The safety of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients who have deep brain stimulation (DBS) implants represents a significant clinical issue. A major safety concern is the presence of burr holes and electrode anchoring devices in the skull, which may alter the induced electric field distribution in the brain. We simulated the electric field using finite-element method in a five-shell spherical head model. Three DBS electrode anchoring techniques were modeled, including ring/cap, microplate, and burr-hole cover. ECT was modeled with bilateral (BL), right unilateral (RUL), and bifrontal (BF) electrode placements and with clinically-used stimulus current amplitude. We compared electric field strength and focality among the DBS implantation techniques and ECT electrode configurations. The simulation results show an increase in the electric field strength in the brain due to conduction through the burr holes, especially when the burr holes are not fitted with nonconductive caps. For typical burr hole placement for subthalamic nucleus DBS, the effect on the electric field strength and focality is strongest for BF ECT, which runs contrary to the belief that more anterior ECT electrode placements are safer in patients with DBS implants. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The World Health Organization estimates depression as a serious threat to the health of millions of people worldwide. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the ongoing research devoted to the investigation of a possibility to use low-field electromagnetic stimulation of the human brain in the treatment of depressive disorder. In the course of the work the 3D models of transcranial magnetic stimulation and low-field magnetic stimulation based upon the use of a layered sphere head model have been developed. An initial approach towards the realistic human head reconstruction has been made. The revealed order of the stimulating electromagnetic field suitable for operation makes it possible to draft a technical specification for the stimulation device. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) devices suffer of poor targeting and penetration depth. A new approach to designing TMS coils is introduced in order to improve the focus of the stimulation region through the use of actively shielded probes. Iterative optimization techniques were used to design different active shielding coils for TMS probes. The new approach aims to increase the amount of energy deposited in a thin cylindrical region below the probe relative to the energy deposited elsewhere in the region (&amp;quot;sharpness&amp;quot;), whereas, simultaneously increase the induced electric field deep in the target region relative to the surface (&amp;quot;penetration&amp;quot;). After convergence, the resulting designs showed that there is a clear tradeoff between sharpness and penetration that can be controlled by the choice of a tuning parameter. The resulting designs were tested on a realistic human head conductivity model, taking the contribution from surface charges into account. The design of choice reduced penetration depths by 16.7%. The activated surface area was reduced by 24.1% and the volume of the activation was reduced from 42.6% by the shield. Restoring the lost penetration could be achieved by increasing the total power to the coil by 16.3%, but in that case, the stimulated volume reduction was only 13.1% and there was a slight increase in the stimulated surface area (2.9%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> INTRODUCTION: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the globus pallidus internus (GPi) are the most common surgical targets for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We studied directionally colored fractional anisotropy (FA) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) sequences to better target these anatomical regions.METHODS: Four patients undergoing stereotactic surgery for movement disorders were studied. Stereotactic targets and fiber tractography were determined on MRIs using the Schaltenbrand-Wahren atlas for definition in the iPlan software. In addition, post-operative imaging was fused to preoperative FA sequences for end-result identification. Axial, sagittal, and coronal images of the FA sequence were studied. DTI parameters used ranged from 2 to 4 mm for voxel size in the x/y/z planes, fiber length was kept constant at 15 mm and FA threshold of 0.25.RESULTS: Colored FA maps resulted in a key signature in and around the STN and GPi. Regions identified include, but were not limited to: the internal capsule, nigral projections, the thalamic fasciculus, Forel's fields H1 and H2, zona incerta, suthalamic fasciculus, tegmental tracts, and cerebello-rubro-thalamic tract.CONCLUSIONS: Colored FA maps allow a potential method to identify the STN and GPi accurately. DTI has proven to be a powerful tool that can be used to augment identification of the STN nucleus and GPi used for stereotactic surgery. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: To investigate steering the volume of activated tissue (VTA) with deep brain stimulation (DBS) using a novel high spatial-resolution lead design.METHODS: We examined the effect of asymmetric current-injection across the DBS-array on the VTA. These predictions were then evaluated acutely in a non-human primate implanted with the DBS-array, using motor side-effect thresholds as the metric for estimating VTA asymmetries.RESULTS: Simulations show the DBS-array, with electrodes arranged together in a cylindrical configuration, can generate field distributions equivalent to commercial DBS leads, and these field distributions can be modulated using field-steering methods. Stimulation with implanted DBS-arrays showed directionally-selective muscle activation, presumably through spread of stimulation fields into portions of the corticospinal tract lying in the internal capsule.CONCLUSIONS: Our computational and experimental studies demonstrate that the DBS-array is capable of spatially selective stimulation. Displacing VTAs away from the lead's axis can be achieved using a single simple and intuitive control parameter.SIGNIFICANCE: Optimal DBS likely requires non-uniform VTAs that may differentially affect a nucleus or fiber pathway. The DBS-array allows positioning VTAs with sub-millimeter precision, which is especially relevant for those patients with DBS leads placed in sub-optimal locations. This may present clinicians with an additional degree of freedom to optimize the DBS therapy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1002/hbm.21096 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) can be relieved by deep brain stimulation (DBS). The mechanism of action of DBS is largely unclear. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) studies on DBS patients have been unfeasible because of strong magnetic artifacts. An artifact suppression method known as spatiotemporal signal space separation (tSSS) has mainly overcome these difficulties. We wanted to clarify whether tSSS enables noninvasive measurement of the modulation of cortical activity caused by DBS. We have studied auditory and somatosensory-evoked fields (AEFs and SEFs) of advanced PD patients with bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS using MEG. AEFs were elicited by 1-kHz tones and SEFs by electrical pulses to the median nerve with DBS on and off. Data could be successfully acquired and analyzed from 12 out of 16 measured patients. The motor symptoms were significantly relieved by DBS, which clearly enhanced the ipsilateral auditory N100m responses in the right hemisphere. Contralateral N100m responses and somatosensory P60m responses also had a tendency to increase when bilateral DBS was on. MEG with tSSS offers a novel and powerful tool to investigate DBS modulation of the evoked cortical activity in PD with high temporal and spatial resolution. The results suggest that STN-DBS modulates auditory processing in advanced PD. Hum Brain Mapp, 2011. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: MRI in patients bearing deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes may induce cerebral lesions due to electrode heating. To avoid neurological deficits related to MRI, post-operative MRI protocol was installed in our institution. However, our protocol comprised a higher specific absorption rate (SAR) and different positioning of lead excess than the later released electrode manufacturer's guidelines. The objective was to evaluate the safety using this protocol.METHODS: Between January 2000 and May 2008, post-operative MRI was performed in all patients. In selected patients, additional MRI scans were performed with the implanted generator. MRI was acquired at 1.5 T with a RF transmit/receive head coil comprising a T2-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) and a T1-weighted inversion recovery FSE sequence. Local cranial SAR values measured up to 0.9 W/kg compared to the manufacturer's recommendation of 0.1 W/kg. Initial scans (1-7 days after surgery) were performed with externalized leads, long-term scans (&amp;gt;30 days after surgery) with a connected generator. New neurological deficits were assessed before and after MRI. Additional MRIs were compared to the initial postoperative MRI with emphasis on new lesions.RESULTS: In 211 patients, 243 MRIs were performed, including 212 initial post-operative MRI. In 12% (n = 24), 31 additional MRI examinations for various clinical reasons were achieved. No patients demonstrated new neurological deficits during or after MRI acquisitions.CONCLUSIONS: No complications were observed using this MRI protocol in DBS patients. Our results suggest that, within this setting, higher SAR values may be feasible for DBS patients than in the manufacturer's guidelines. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Over 70,000 DBS devices have been implanted worldwide; however, there remains a paucity of well-characterized post-mortem DBS brains available to researchers. We propose that the overall understanding of DBS can be improved through the establishment of a Deep Brain Stimulation-Brain Tissue Network (DBS-BTN), which will further our understanding of DBS and brain function. The objectives of the tissue bank are twofold: (a) to provide a complete (clinical, imaging and pathological) database for DBS brain tissue samples, and (b) to make available DBS tissue samples to researchers, which will help our understanding of disease and underlying brain circuitry. Standard operating procedures for processing DBS brains were developed as part of the pilot project. Complete data files were created for individual patients and included demographic information, clinical information, imaging data, pathology, and DBS lead locations/settings. 19 DBS brains were collected from 11 geographically dispersed centers from across the U.S. The average age at the time of death was 69.3 years (51-92, with a standard deviation or SD of 10.13). The male:female ratio was almost 3:1. Average post-mortem interval from death to brain collection was 10.6 h (SD of 7.17). The DBS targets included: subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus interna, and ventralis intermedius nucleus of the thalamus. In 16.7% of cases the clinical diagnosis failed to match the pathological diagnosis. We provide neuropathological findings from the cohort, and perilead responses to DBS. One of the most important observations made in this pilot study was the missing data, which was approximately 25% of all available data fields. Preliminary results demonstrated the feasibility and utility of creating a National DBS-BTN resource for the scientific community. We plan to improve our techniques to remedy omitted clinical/research data, and expand the Network to include a larger donor pool. We will enhance sample preparation to facilitate advanced molecular studies and progenitor cell retrieval. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: The study of brain functioning is a major challenge in neuroscience fields as human brain has a dynamic and ever changing information processing. Case is worsened with conditions where brain undergoes major changes in so-called different conscious states. Even though the exact definition of consciousness is a hard one, there are certain conditions where the descriptions have reached a consensus. The sleep and the anesthesia are different conditions which are separable from each other and also from wakefulness. The aim of our group has been to tackle the issue of brain functioning with setting up similar research conditions for these three conscious states.METHODS: In order to achieve this goal we have designed an auditory stimulation battery with changing conditions to be recorded during a 40 channel EEG polygraph (Nuamps) session. The stimuli (modified mismatch, auditory evoked etc.) have been administered both in the operation room and the sleep lab via Embedded Interactive Stimulus Unit which was developed in our lab. The overall study has provided some results for three domains of consciousness. In order to be able to monitor the changes we have incorporated Bispectral Index Monitoring to both sleep and anesthesia conditions.RESULTS: The first stage results have provided a basic understanding in these altered states such that auditory stimuli have been successfully processed in both light and deep sleep stages. The anesthesia provides a sudden change in brain responsiveness; therefore a dosage dependent anesthetic administration has proved to be useful. The auditory processing was exemplified targeting N1 wave, with a thorough analysis from spectrogram to sLORETA. The frequency components were observed to be shifting throughout the stages. The propofol administration and the deeper sleep stages both resulted in the decreasing of N1 component. The sLORETA revealed similar activity at BA7 in sleep (BIS 70) and target propofol concentration of 1.2 microg/mL.CONCLUSIONS: The current study utilized similar stimulation and recording system and incorporated BIS dependent values to validate a common approach to sleep and anesthesia. Accordingly the brain has a complex behavior pattern, dynamically changing its responsiveness in accordance with stimulations and states. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s00115-010-2941-8 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Since approximately 10 years investigations have been carried out on the impact of deep brain stimulation (DBS) of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorders and depression. New fields of application are for Tourette's syndrome, substance abuse, dementia and anxiety. New functional, structural and molecular data have led to a new conceptualization of these disorders as dysfunctions of networks which process motivational and affective stimuli. DBS permits the selective and basically reversible modulation of such networks. So far adverse effects have been graded as marginal. In the field of treatment-resistant obsessive-compulsive disorders and depressive disorders uncontrolled studies have been published with initial satisfactory and concordant indications of the therapeutic effect of DBS in a variety of target areas of the brain. It is most important to provide a consistent interdisciplinary and durable development of concepts for a responsible use of DBS in patients with psychiatric disorders. Only in this way can the potentially most interesting therapeutic development of clinical psychiatry of the last 20 years be continued uninterrupted. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.3233/RNN-2010-0488 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: Previous work has established that the integrative capacity of multisensory neurons in the superior colliculus (SC) matures over a protracted period of postnatal life (Wallace and Stein, 1997), and that the development of normal patterns of multisensory integration depends critically on early sensory experience (Wallace et al., 2004). Although these studies demonstrated the importance of early sensory experience in the creation of mature multisensory circuits, it remains unknown whether the reestablishment of sensory experience in adulthood can reverse these effects and restore integrative capacity.METHODS: The current study tested this hypothesis in cats that were reared in absolute darkness until adulthood and then returned to a normal housing environment for an equivalent period of time. Single unit extracellular recordings targeted multisensory neurons in the deep layers of the SC, and analyses were focused on both conventional measures of multisensory integration and on more recently developed methods designed to characterize spatiotemporal receptive fields (STRF).RESULTS: Analysis of the STRF structure and integrative capacity of multisensory SC neurons revealed significant modifications in the temporal response dynamics of multisensory responses (e.g., discharge durations, peak firing rates, and mean firing rates), as well as significant changes in rates of spontaneous activation and degrees of multisensory integration.CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the importance of early sensory experience in the establishment of normal multisensory processing architecture and highlight the limited plastic potential of adult multisensory circuits. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Dystonia is not uncommon in childhood, but is clinically very heterogeneous. Therefore, introduction and follow-up of the treatment of dystonia in children are often a challenge for the physicians. Progresses in functional neurosurgery have open new fields in the treatment of dystonia in children, but it should be managed by a multidisciplinary team. This paper reviews the various therapeutic options available for childhood-onset dystonia, with a specific attention to dosage and side effects of the drugs regarding pediatric population according to the data of the literature. The rational strategy for therapeutic management of the various types of childhood dystonia is discussed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: We report a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of bilateral stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus for localization-related epilepsy.METHODS: Participants were adults with medically refractory partial seizures, including secondarily generalized seizures. Half received stimulation and half no stimulation during a 3-month blinded phase; then all received unblinded stimulation.RESULTS: One hundred ten participants were randomized. Baseline monthly median seizure frequency was 19.5. In the last month of the blinded phase the stimulated group had a 29% greater reduction in seizures compared with the control group, as estimated by a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model (p = 0.002). Unadjusted median declines at the end of the blinded phase were 14.5% in the control group and 40.4% in the stimulated group. Complex partial and &amp;quot;most severe&amp;quot; seizures were significantly reduced by stimulation. By 2 years, there was a 56% median percent reduction in seizure frequency; 54% of patients had a seizure reduction of at least 50%, and 14 patients were seizure-free for at least 6 months. Five deaths occurred and none were from implantation or stimulation. No participant had symptomatic hemorrhage or brain infection. Two participants had acute, transient stimulation-associated seizures. Cognition and mood showed no group differences, but participants in the stimulated group were more likely to report depression or memory problems as adverse events.DISCUSSION: Bilateral stimulation of the anterior nuclei of the thalamus reduces seizures. Benefit persisted for 2 years of study. Complication rates were modest. Deep brain stimulation of the anterior thalamus is useful for some people with medically refractory partial and secondarily generalized seizures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The site for permanent stimulation is still in debate. This study aimed to assess the position of active contacts in relation to the subthalamic nucleus.METHODS: We reviewed the location of 40 electrodes in 34 patients who underwent STN-DBS. The position of electrode was evaluated by postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The position of active contacts was compared with the subthalamic nucleus (STN) determined by intraoperative electrophysiological mapping and postoperative MRI.RESULTS: The average position of the 40 active contacts was (11.7 + or - 1.2) mm lateral, (0.6 + or - 1.3) mm anterior, and (0.7 + or - 1.4) mm vertical to the midcommissural point. The dorsal margin of the STN was (11.6 + or - 1.1) mm lateral, (0.2 + or - 1.1) mm anterior, and (1.3 + or - 1.1) mm vertical to the midcommissural point. When compared with the dorsal margin of the STN, the active contacts were located more dorsally (P = 0.033) and anteriorly (P = 0.012), no significant difference was found in the lateral direction (P = 0.107). When compared with the position of the STN, 26 (65%) of active contacts were located in the region dorsal to the STN, only 13 (32.5%) were located in the upper two-thirds portion of STN.CONCLUSIONS: The site for permanent stimulation appears to be in the subthalamic region dorsal to the STN, close to the dorsal margin of the STN. Besides the dorsal portion of the STN, other structures such as fields of Forel H and zona incerta may also be involved in the therapeutic benefit of deep brain stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1088/1741-2560/7/1/016005 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) achieves therapeutic outcome through generation of electric fields (EF) in the vicinity of energized electrodes. Targeted brain regions are highly vascularized, and it remains unknown if DBS electric fields modulate blood-brain barrier (BBB) function, either through electroporation of individual endothelial cells or electro-permeation of barrier tight junctions. In our study, we calculated the intensities of EF generated around energized Medtronic 3387 and 3389 DBS leads by using a finite element model. Then we designed a novel stimulation system to study the effects of such fields with DBS-relevant waveforms and intensities on bovine aortic endothelial cell (BAEC) monolayers, which were used as a basic analog for the blood-brain barrier endothelium. Following 5 min of stimulation, we observed a transient increase in endothelial hydraulic conductivity (Lp) that could be related to the disruption of the tight junctions (TJ) between cells, as suggested by zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) protein staining. This 'electro-permeation' occurred in the absence of cell death or single cell electroporation, as indicated by propidium iodide staining and cytosolic calcein uptake. Our in vitro results, using uniform fields and BAEC monolayers, thus suggest that electro-permeation of the BBB may occur at electric field intensities below those inducing electroporation and within intensities generated near DBS electrodes. Further studies are necessary to address potential BBB disruption during clinical studies, with safety and efficacy implications. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The subthalamic nucleus in primary dystonia: single-unit discharge characteristics. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1152/jn.00544.2009 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Most models of dystonia pathophysiology predict alterations of activity in the basal ganglia thalamocortical motor circuit. The globus pallidus interna (GPi) shows bursting and oscillatory neuronal discharge in both human dystonia and in animal models, but it is not clear which intrinsic basal ganglia pathways are implicated in this abnormal output. The subthalamic nucleus (STN) receives prominent excitatory input directly from cortical areas implicated in dystonia pathogenesis and inhibitory input from the external globus pallidus. The goal of this study was to elucidate the role of the STN in dystonia by analyzing STN neuronal discharge in patients with idiopathic dystonia. Data were collected in awake patients undergoing microelectrode recording for implantation of STN deep brain stimulation electrodes. We recorded 62 STN neurons in 9 patients with primary dystonia. As a comparison group, we recorded 143 STN neurons in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Single-unit activity was discriminated off-line by principal component analysis and evaluated with respect to discharge rate, bursting, and oscillatory activity. The mean STN discharge rate in dystonia patients was 26.3 Hz (SD 13.6), which was lower than that in the PD patients (35.6 Hz, SD 15.2), but higher than published values for subjects without basal ganglia dysfunction. Oscillatory activity was found in both disorders, with a higher proportion of units oscillating in the beta range in PD. Bursting discharge was a prominent feature of both dystonia and PD, whereas sensory receptive fields were expanded in PD compared with dystonia. The STN firing characteristics, in conjunction with those previously published for GPi, suggest that bursting and oscillatory discharge in basal ganglia output may be transmitted via pathways involving the STN and provide a pathophysiologic rationale for STN as a surgical target in dystonia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The question whether pain encoding in the human insula shows some somatotopic organization is still pending. We studied 142 patients undergoing depth stereotactic EEG (SEEG) exploration of the insular cortex for pre-surgical evaluation of epilepsy. 472 insular electrical stimulations were delivered, of which only 49 (10.5%) elicited a painful sensation in 38 patients (27%). Most sites where low intensity electric stimulation produced pain, without after-discharge or concomitant visually detectable change in EEG activity outside the insula, were located in the posterior two thirds of the insula. Pain was located in a body area restricted to face, upper limb or lower limb for 27 stimulations (55%) and affected more than one of these regions for all others. The insular cortex being oriented parallel to the medial sagittal plane we found no significant difference between body segment representations in the medio-lateral axis. Conversely a somatotopic organization of sites where stimulation produced pain was observed along the rostro-caudal and vertical axis of the insula, showing a face representation rostral to those of upper and lower limbs, with an upper limb representation located above that of the lower limb. These data suggest that, in spite of large and often bilateral receptive fields, pain representation shows some degree of somatotopic organization in the human insula. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/S0079-6123(09)17525-8 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Since the 1960s, deep brain stimulation and spinal cord stimulation at low frequency (30 Hz) have been used to treat intractable pain of various origins. For this purpose, specific hardware have been designed, including deep brain electrodes, extensions, and implantable programmable generators (IPGs). In the meantime, movement disorders, and particularly parkinsonian and essential tremors, were treated by electrolytic or mechanic lesions in various targets of the basal ganglia, particularly in the thalamus and in the internal pallidum. The advent in the 1960s of levodopa, as well as the side effects and complications of ablative surgery (e.g., thalamotomy and pallidotomy), has sent functional neurosurgery of movement disorders to oblivion. In 1987, the serendipitous discovery of the effect of high-frequency stimulation (HFS), mimicking lesions, allowed the revival of the surgery of movement disorders by stimulation of the thalamus, which treated tremors with limited morbidity, and adaptable and reversible results. The stability along time of these effects allowed extending it to new targets suggested by basic research in monkeys. The HFS of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) has profoundly challenged the practice of functional surgery as the effect on the triad of dopaminergic symptoms was very significant, allowing to decrease the drug dosage and therefore a decrease of their complications, the levodopa-induced dyskinesias. In the meantime, based on the results of previous basic research in various fields, HFS has been progressively extended to potentially treat epilepsy and, more recently, psychiatric disorders, such as obsessive-compulsive disorders, Gilles de la Tourette tics, and severe depression. Similarly, suggested by the observation of changes in PET scan, applications have been extended to cluster headaches by stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus and even more recently, to obesity and drug addiction. In the field of movement disorders, it has become clear that STN stimulation is not efficient on the nondopaminergic symptoms such as freezing of gait. Based on experimental data obtained in MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys, the pedunculopontine nucleus has been used as a new target, and as suggested by the animal research results, its use indeed improves walking and stability when stimulation is performed at low frequency (25 Hz). The concept of simultaneous stimulation of multiple targets eventually at low or high frequency, and that of several electrodes in one target, is being accepted to increase the efficiency. This leads to and is being facilitated by the development of new hardware (multiple-channel IPGs, specific electrodes, rechargeable batteries). Still additional efforts are needed at the level of the stimulation paradigm and in the waveform. The recent development of nanotechnologies allows the design of totally new systems expanding the field of deep brain stimulation. These new techniques will make it possible to not only inhibit or excite deep brain structures to alleviate abnormal symptoms but also open the field for the use of recording cortical activities to drive neuroprostheses through brain-computer interfaces. The new field of compensation of deficits will then become part of the field of functional neurosurgery. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study presents a whole-head finite element model of deep brain stimulation to examine the effect of electrical grounding, the finite conducting volume of the head, and scalp, skull and cerebrospinal fluid layers. The impedance between the stimulating and reference electrodes in the whole-head model was found to lie within clinically reported values when the reference electrode was incorporated on a localized surface in the model. Incorporation of the finite volume of the head and inclusion of surrounding outer tissue layers reduced the magnitude of the electric field and activating function by approximately 20% in the region surrounding the electrode. Localized distortions of the electric field were also observed when the electrode was placed close to the skull. Under bipolar conditions the effect of the finite conducting volume was shown to be negligible. The results indicate that, for monopolar stimulation, incorporation of the finite volume and outer tissue layers can alter the magnitude of the electric field and activating function when the electrode is deep within the brain, and may further affect the shape if the electrode is close to the skull. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an increasingly used surgical therapy for a range of neurological disorders involving the long-term electrical stimulation of various regions of the human brain in a disorder specific manner. Despite being used for the last 20 years, the underlying mechanisms are still not known, and disputed. In particular, when the electrodes are implanted into the human brain, an interface is created with changing biophysical properties which may impact on stimulation. We previously defined the electrode-brain interface (EBI) as consisting of three structural elements: the quadripolar DBS electrode, the peri-electrode space and the surrounding brain tissue. In order to understand more about the nature of this EBI, we used structural computational models of this interface, and estimated the effects of stimulation using coupled axon models. These finite element models differ in complexity, each highlighting a different feature of the EBI's effect on the DBS-induced electric field. We show that the quasi-static models are sufficient to demonstrate the difference between the acute and chronic clinical stages post-implantation. However, the frequency-dependent models are necessary as the waveform shaping has a major influence on the activation of neuronal fibres. We also investigate anatomical effects on the electric field, by taking specific account of the ventricular system in the human brain. Taken together, these models allow us to visualise the static, dynamic and target specific properties of the DBS-induced field in the surrounding brain regions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1002/hbm.20788 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Auditory brainstem responses provide diagnostic value in pathologies involving the early parts of the auditory pathway. Despite that, the neural generators underlying the various components of these responses have remained unclear. Direct electrical recordings in humans are possible only in limited time periods during surgery and from small regions of the diseased brains. The evidence of the generator sites is therefore fragmented and indirect, based strongly on lesion studies and animal models. Source modeling of EEG has been limited to grand averages across multiple subjects. Here, we employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) to shed more light on the neural origins of the auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and to test whether such deep brain structures are accessible by MEG. We show that the magnetic counterparts of the electric ABRs can be measured in 30 min and that they allow localization of some of the underlying neural sources in individual subjects. Many of the electric ABR components were present in our MEG data; however, the morphologies of the magnetic and electric responses were different, indicating that the MEG signals carry information complementary to the EEG data. The locations of the neural sources corresponding to the magnetic ABR deflections ranged from the auditory nerve to the inferior colliculus. The earliest cortical responses were detectable at the latency of 13 ms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s12630-009-9056-3 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: Patients with implanted electrical devices (IEDs) are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI) from electrical equipment used in the perioperative environment. As the indications for non-cardiac IEDs increase, so too does the likelihood of anesthesiologists encountering such patients who present for surgery. This article reviews the important anesthetic considerations for patients with implanted non-cardiac electrical devices.SOURCE: We searched Medline (1980 to December 2008) and Embase (1980 to December 2008) and reviewed all relevant manuscripts regarding non-cardiac IEDs and anesthesia.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: There are numerous non-cardiac IEDs currently in use, including deep brain stimulators, vagal nerve stimulators, gastric stimulators, phrenic nerve stimulators, sacral nerve stimulators, and bone stimulators. A key goal in the perioperative management of these patients is to reduce the risk of adverse events resulting from device interactions with electrocautery, external emergency cardiac defibrillation, peripheral nerve stimulation, neuraxial anesthesia, and magnetic resonance imaging. We offer a general management strategy for patients with IEDs presenting for surgery.CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of available anesthesia management guidelines regarding non-cardiac IEDs in the perioperative setting, anesthesiologists should appreciate the basic principles pertaining to IEDs to ensure appropriate risk reduction strategies in order to enhance patient safety. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECT: High-frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with parkinsonian symptoms is often used to ameliorate debilitating motor symptoms associated with this condition. However, individual variability in the shape and orientation of this relatively small nucleus results in multiple side effects related to the spread of electrical current to surrounding structures. Specifically, contraction of the muscles of facial expression is noted in a small percentage of patients, although the precise mechanism remains poorly understood.METHODS: Facial muscle contraction was triggered by high-frequency stimulation of 49 contacts in 18 patients undergoing deep brain stimulation of the STN. The mean coordinates of these individual contacts relative to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure midpoint (also called the midcommissural point) were calculated to determine the location or structure(s) most often associated with facial contraction during physiological macrostimulation.RESULTS: The x, y, and z coordinates associated with contraction of the facial musculature were found to be 11.52, 1.29, and 1.15 mm lateral, posterior, and inferior to the midcommissural point, respectively. This location, along the lateral-anterior-superior border of the STN, may allow for the spread of electrical current to the fields of Forel, zona incerta, and/or descending corticospinal/corticobulbar tracts. Because stimulation of corticobulbar tracts produces similar findings, these results are best explained by the spread of electrical current to nearby internal capsule axons coursing lateral to the STN.CONCLUSIONS: Thus, if intraoperative deep brain stimulation lead testing results in facial musculature contraction, placement of the electrode in a more medial, posterior position may reduce the amount of current spread to corticobulbar fibers and resolve this side effect. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> For nearly fifteen years, the impact of modern neuroscience has become a central focus of public debate, not just following the Decade of the Brain in the United States. Newly developed options for manipulating the central nervous system (CNS) are not only of primary medical concern but have come to be regarded as extremely questionable in recent bioethical discourse. This article provides an in-depth comparison between modern neuromanipulative approaches from &amp;quot;Deep Brain Stimulation&amp;quot; (DBS) with methods from earlier historical periods. After World War II, electrophysiological stimulation was developed, which changed the functional capacity of the human brain. It is argued that many contemporary debates questioning neuroethical applications are flawed in significant respects: A unique neuroethical position can neither be upheld philosophically nor with regard to consumer-oriented clinical practice. By drawing on individual case examples from the contemporary and recent history of neuroscience, some related problem fields and consequences are mapped out and discussed. They show an increasingly blurred conceptual boundary furnished by the complex relations between clinical research, physiological restitution, and functional enhancement inherent in modern biomedicine. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and shows great promise for numerous other disorders. While the fundamental purpose of DBS is to modulate neural activity with electric fields, little is known about the actual voltage distribution generated in the brain by DBS electrodes and as a result it is difficult to accurately predict which brain areas are directly affected by the stimulation. The goal of this study was to characterize the spatial and temporal characteristics of the voltage distribution generated by DBS electrodes. We experimentally recorded voltages around active DBS electrodes in either a saline bath or implanted in the brain of a non-human primate. Recordings were made during voltage-controlled and current-controlled stimulation. The experimental findings were compared to volume conductor electric field models of DBS parameterized to match the different experiments. Three factors directly affected the experimental and theoretical voltage measurements: 1) DBS electrode impedance, primarily dictated by a voltage drop at the electrode-electrolyte interface and the conductivity of the tissue medium, 2) capacitive modulation of the stimulus waveform, and 3) inhomogeneity and anisotropy of the tissue medium. While the voltage distribution does not directly predict the neural response to DBS, the results of this study do provide foundational building blocks for understanding the electrical parameters of DBS and characterizing its effects on the nervous system. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.11.029 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We have examined the effect of the peripheral application of glutamate and capsaicin to deep craniofacial tissues in influencing the activation and peripheral sensitization of deep craniofacial nociceptive afferents. The activity of single trigeminal nociceptive afferents with receptive fields in deep craniofacial tissues were recorded extracellularly in 55 halothane-anesthetized rats. The mechanical activation threshold (MAT) of each afferent was assessed before and after injection of 0.5 M glutamate (or vehicle) and 1% capsaicin (or vehicle) into the receptive field. A total of 68 afferents that could be activated by blunt noxious mechanical stimulation of the deep craniofacial tissues (23 masseter, 5 temporalis, 40 temporomandibular joint) were studied. When injected alone, glutamate and capsaicin activated and induced peripheral sensitization reflected as MAT reduction in many afferents. Following glutamate injection, capsaicin-evoked activity was greater than that evoked by capsaicin alone, whereas following capsaicin injection, glutamate-evoked responses were similar to glutamate alone. These findings indicate that peripheral application of glutamate or capsaicin may activate or induce peripheral sensitization in a subpopulation of trigeminal nociceptive afferents innervating deep craniofacial tissues, as reflected in changes in MAT and other afferent response properties. The data further suggest that peripheral glutamate and capsaicin receptor mechanisms may interact to modulate the activation and peripheral sensitization in some deep craniofacial nociceptive afferents. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1159/000175800 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> INTRODUCTION: Several deep brain targets have been assessed for the treatment of unresectable refractory epileptic conditions. Adrian Upton in 1985 proposed deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus for the treatment of seizures and psychosis [Cooper I.S., Upton A.R.: Biol Psychiatry 1985;20:811-813]. Francisco Velasco, in 1987, introduced DBS of the thalamic centromedian nucleus, proposing its employment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and for multifocal epilepsy. Other proposed targets are the subthalamic nucleus, caudate nucleus, Forel fields and mammillothalamic tract. We employed DBS for stimulating 2 'unconventional targets', the posterior hypothalamus (pHyp) and caudal zona incerta (CZi), for the treatment of 2 patients with multifocal epilepsy and behavioural comorbidity, and 2 patients with sensorimotor focal seizures, respectively. Such patients did not meet criteria for resective surgery.MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our institution, between January 2003 and May 2004, we started DBS in 2 epileptic patients The former patient was affected by multifocal epilepsy, and the second one by refractory partial motor and secondary generalized seizures. The chosen targets were the pHyp in the former case and the CZi in the latter. The encouraging results obtained led us to replicate such a favourable experience in 2 more patients, 1 with focal motor epilepsy once again (resulting in status epilepticus) and the other with behavioural comorbidity and multifocal epilepsy.RESULTS: A significant reduction in seizure frequency was observed, and the 2 patients with behavioural comorbidity also showed a dramatic improvement in their disruptive behaviour. The patient with motor focal seizures showed a 70% reduction in seizure frequency, and in the last patient remission from status epilepticus was obtained.CONCLUSION: Our data confirm DBSof deep brain structures modulates the functional activity of the cerebral cortex as suggested by Adrian Upton in 1985. In the reported series, deep-brain stimulation of 2 unconventional targets belonging to the reticulo-cortical system (the brainstem-diencephalon functional system including structures that act as remote controls in modulating cortical excitability) was found to be effective in controlling otherwise refractory multifocal (pHyp) and focal sensorimotor (CZi) epilepsy when resective surgery was not feasible. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To gain a complete understanding of how the brain functions, both in illness and good health, data from multiple levels of analysis must be integrated. Technical advances have made direct recordings of neuronal activity deep inside the human brain tractable, providing a rare glimpse into cellular processes during long-term memory formation. Recent findings using intracranial recordings in the medial temporal lobe inform current neural network models of memory, and may lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the neural basis of memory-related processes.RECENT FINDINGS: These recordings have shown that cells in the hippocampus appear to support declarative learning by distinguishing novel and familiar stimuli via changes in firing patterns. Some cells with highly selective and invariant responses have also been described, and these responses seem to represent abstract concepts such as identity, rather than superficial perceptual features of items. Importantly, however, both selective and globally responsive cells are capable of changing their preferred stimulus depending on the conscious demands of the task.SUMMARY: Firing patterns of human medial temporal lobe neurons indicate that cells can be both plastic and stable in terms of the information that they code; although some cells show highly selective and reproducible excitatory responses when presented with a familiar object, other cells change their receptive fields in line with changes in experience and the cognitive environment. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Producing accurate movements may rely on the functional independence of sensorimotor circuits within basal ganglia nuclei. In parkinsonism there is abnormal synchrony of electrical activity within these circuits that results in a loss of independence across motor channels. Local field potential (LFP) recordings reflect the summation of local electrical fields and an increase in LFP power reflects increased synchrony in local neuronal networks. We recorded LFPs from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead in the operating room in 22 cases from 16 subjects with Parkinson's disease (PD) who were off medication. There was elevated LFP power at beta frequencies (13-35 Hz) at rest. The LFP spectral profile was consistent across several periods of rest that were separated by movement and/or DBS, and appeared to be a relatively stationary phenomenon. The spectral profile and frequencies of the beta-band peak(s) varied among subjects but were similar between the right and left STNs within certain individuals. These results suggest that the LFP spectrum at rest may characterize a &amp;quot;signature&amp;quot; rhythm for an individual with PD. Beta-band power was attenuated after intra-operative STN DBS (p&amp;lt;0.05). The attenuation lasted for 10 s after short periods (30 s) and for up to 50 s after longer periods (5 min) of DBS. The finding that longer periods of DBS attenuated beta power for a longer time suggests that there may be long-acting functional changes to networks in the STN in PD after chronic DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Evaluation of electromagnetic incompatibility concerns for deep brain stimulators. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulators (DBS) may be affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI). Little research has been conducted regarding this phenomenon, although supportive background information and a literature review offer implications of EMI for persons who have this device. The warning information on Medtronic's Web site that is specific to the DBS device indicates that theft detectors and security screening devices may cause the stimulation to turn on or off and may cause some patients to experience a momentary increase in perceived stimulation. This information supports the rationale for practitioners to recommend that patients with DBS turn off their device when anticipating exposure to EMI. EMI with DBS does not appear to present an immediate safety issue even though it may cause device malfunction and a resulting temporary interruption in therapeutic benefit for persons who have the device. However, the absence of sound research on the effects of EMI on DBS does not permit the exclusion of EMI as a potential health concern. Meanwhile, healthcare professionals who care for patients with DBS should routinely educate them about potential interactions and appropriate accommodations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Quantitative evaluation of the sensory disturbance of the tongue is important clinically. However, because the conventional electrophysiological approach to the peripheral nerve cannot be used in the mandible owing to the deep route of the lingual nerve, we applied evoked potentials in the central nervous system. Somatosensory evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) following electric stimulation were recorded in 10 healthy subjects by means of pin electrodes placed on the tongue mucosa. Three or four components (P25m, P40m, P60m, and P80m) were identified over the contralateral hemisphere with unilateral stimulation. Because none of the components were consistently detected in all subjects, we evaluated the root mean square (RMS) of 18 channels over the contralateral hemisphere. To estimate the activated cortical response, we calculated the difference in mean RMS amplitude between 10 and 150 ms and that of the baseline period (aRMS=RMS[10, 150]-RMS[-50, -5]). The aRMS values for right-sided and left-sided stimulation were 10.18+/-7.92 and 10.99+/-8.98 fT/cm, respectively, and the mean laterality index, expressed by [(left-right)/(left+right)] was 0.025+/-0.104. This parameter can be useful for evaluating patients with unilateral sensory abnormality of the tongue. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> We report the case of a psychiatrically healthy Parkinson's disease patient who presented acute transient depressive states related to high frequency stimulation (HFS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and its neighbouring anatomical structures, i.e. the substantia nigra, zona incerta and Forel's fields. This case confirms that the subthalamic region plays a critical role in modulating human behaviour, providing especially sensitive to depressive states elicited by HFS in conditions of increased vulnerability. Worthy of note is the finding that these mood changes presented subsequent adaptation with time, probably as a result of both the disappearance of the microtraumatic effect of the implantation procedure and the plastic changes induced by HFS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1007/s10072-008-0890-9 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Improvement in the biomedical and biotechnological research fields have allowed refinement of the neuromodulation approach in the treatment of a subgroup of medical disorders otherwise refractory to pharmacological treatment, such as chronic primary headaches. Chronic pain conditions imply central sensitisations and functional reorganisation that cannot be quickly or easily reversed. It appears evident that conventional treatment can sometimes be unsuccessful or only partially successful, and that relapse is common. Cluster headache (CH) is the most frequent trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia (TAC) and the most representative of this spectrum of disorders characterised by the association of headache and loco-regional signs and symptoms of facial parasympathetic activation. The striking features of circadian rhythmicity of attacks and circannual periodicity of cluster period, together with the neuroendocrine abnormalities, are suggestive of a neurochronobiological disorder with a central-diencephalic pathogenetic involvement, confirmed by direct evidence in functional neuroimaging studies of ipsilateral posterior hypothalamic activation during cluster attack. In 2000 these findings prompted a functional neurosurgery approach, with the first case of deep brain hypothalamic stimulation (DBS) in a severely disabled chronic CH patient. Since then, 18 implants in our centre and many others in different countries have been performed. Although the outcomes are encouraging, the invasive nature of the technique and the occurrence of rare but major adverse events have suggested a safer peripheral approach with occipital nerve stimulation (ONS). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sensory gating (SG) is a prevalent physiological process important for information filtering in complex systems. SG is evaluated by presenting repetitious stimuli and measuring the degree of neural inhibition that occurs. SG has been found to be impaired in several psychiatric disorders. Recent animal and human research has made great progress in the study of SG, and in this review we provide an overview of recent research on SG using different methods. Animal research has uncovered findings that suggest (1) SG is displayed by single neurons and can be similar to SG observed from scalp recordings in humans, (2) SG is found in numerous brain structures located in sensory, motor and limbic subregions, (3) SG can be significantly influenced by state changes of the organism, and (4) SG has a diverse pharmacological profile accented by a strong influence from nicotine receptor activation. Human research has addressed similar issues using deep electrode recordings of brain structures. These experiments have revealed that (1) SG can be found in cortical regions surrounding hippocampus, (2) the order of neural processing places hippocampal involvement during a later stage of sensory processing than originally thought, and (3) multiple subtypes of gating exist that could be dependent on different brain circuits and more or less influenced by alterations in organismal state. Animal and human research both have limitations. We emphasize the need for integrative approaches to understand the process and combine information between basic and clinical fields so that a more complete picture of SG will emerge. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the hypothesis that increased neuropsychiatric distress and cognitive impairment are associated with lower perceived health status in essential tremor (ET).BACKGROUND: Many patients with ET experience nonmotor complications, including lower perceived health status and poor health-related quality of life, which are associated with tremor severity, age, and personality factors. No studies, however, have examined the potential contribution of neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits to health status in ET.METHOD: Forty-five patients with ET underwent comprehensive neurologic and neuropsychologic evaluations, including self-report measures of physical and psychosocial health status (ie, the Sickness Impact Profile) and neuropsychiatric distress (ie, the Profile of Mood States).RESULTS: A series of hierarchical multiple regressions showed that after considering the effects of ET disease severity, lower vigor, and deficits in executive functions were independently predictive of poorer physical health status, whereas increased symptoms of depression were uniquely associated with lower psychosocial health status.CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that reduced vigor (ie, apathy), executive deficits, and depression are important predictors of poorer perceived health status in ET. Given the prevalence of such nonmotor symptoms, these data highlight the potential value of considering neuropsychiatric and neurocognitive assessments in the management of patients with ET. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Vibration-related neurons in monkey primary somatosensory cortex (SI) discharge rhythmically when vibratory stimuli are presented. It remains unclear how functional information carried by vibratory inputs is coded in rhythmic neuronal activity. In the present study, we compared neuronal activity during wrist movements in response to two sets of cues. In the first, movements were guided by vibratory cue only (VIB trials). In the second, movements were guided by simultaneous presentation of both vibratory and visual cues (COM trials). SI neurons were recorded extracellularly during both wrist extensions and flexions. Neuronal activity during the instructed delay period (IDP) and the early reaction time period (RTP) were analyzed. A total of 96 cases from 48 neurons (each neuron contributed two cases, one each for extension and flexion) showed significant vibration entrainment during the early RTPs, as determined by circular statistics (Rayleigh test). Of these, 50 cases had cutaneous (CUTA) and 46 had deep (DEEP) receptive fields. The CUTA neurons showed lower firing rates during the IDPs and greater firing rate changes during the early RTPs when compared with the DEEP neurons. The CUTA neurons also demonstrated decreases in activity entrainment during VIB trials when compared with COM trials. For the DEEP neurons, the difference of entrainment between VIB and COM trials was not statistically significant. The results suggest that somatic vibratory input is coded by both the firing rate and the activity entrainment of the CUTA neurons in SI. The results also suggest that when vibratory inputs are required for successful task completion, the activity of the CUTA neurons increases but the entrainment degrades. The DEEP neurons may be tuned before movement initiation for processing information encoded by proprioceptive afferents. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 10.1093/cercor/bhm188 </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recent studies have revealed that the auditory cortex (AC) plays a crucial role in the plastic changes in the physiological properties of subcortical auditory neurons through corticofugal projections. In this study with the C57 mouse, we investigated the receptive field plasticity of the ventral division of the medial geniculate body (MGBv) of the thalamus and the impact of the primary AC using the electrical stimulation of the cholinergic basal forebrain, the nucleus basalies, paired with a tone (tone-ES(NB)). We found that tone-ES(NB) evoked significant changes in MGBv receptive fields; the best frequencies (BFs) of MGBv neurons shifted toward the frequency of the paired tone. The BF shifts of MGBv neurons were maximal when the difference between the BFs of MGBv neurons and the frequency of the paired tone was 7 kHz. In addition to the BF shifts, the minimum threshold was decreased and the spike number was increased in response to the paired tone. Importantly, these plastic changes of MGBv neurons were completely abolished when the AC was inactivated with a cortical application of muscimol, a gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A receptor agonist. Our data indicate that the corticofugal system is an essential neural substrate for the sound-specific plasticity in the auditory thalamus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Through the rapid progress in neuropharmacology it seems to become possible to effectively improve our cognitive capacities and emotional states by easily applicable means. Moreover, deep-brain stimulation may allow an effective therapeutic option for those neurological and psychiatric diseases which still can not be sufficiently treated by pharmacological measures. So far, however, both the benefit and the harm of these techniques are only insufficiently understood by neuroscience and detailed ethical analyses are still missing. In this article ethical criteria and most recent empirical evidence are systematically brought together for the first time. This analysis shows that it is irrelevant for an ethical evaluation whether a drug or a brain-machine interface is categorized as &amp;quot;enhancement&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;treatment&amp;quot; or whether it changes &amp;quot;human nature&amp;quot;. The only decisive criteria are whether the intervention (1.) benefits the patient, (2.) does not harm the patient and (3.) is desired by the patient. However, current empirical data in both fields, neuropharmacology and deep-brain stimulation are still too sparse to adequately evaluate these criteria. Moreover, the focus in both fields has been strongly misled by neglecting the distinction between &amp;quot;benefit&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;efficacy&amp;quot;: In past years research and clinical practice have only focused on physiological effects, but not on the actual benefit to the patient. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stimulation of deep brain regions with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) may have an important role as a therapy to treat chemical dependency and depression. The coils traditionally used in TMS, however, have a poor performance in stimulating deep neurons. In this work we study the usage of high permeability cores combined with coils specifically designed to induce fields that decay slowly with depth. By using the finite elements method we show that the use of such cores increases the field's magnitude, decreases its decay rate and improves its focality. Such improvements make these high permeability core coils more suited to stimulate deep brain regions. </td>

We have observed transient entrainment of spike and wave activity during spontaneous seizures with open loop sinusoidal stimulation with frequencies between 9-15 Hz.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chronic, high-frequency electrical stimulation of subcortical brain structures (deep brain stimulation [DBS]) is an effective clinical treatment for several medically refractory neurological disorders. However, the clinical successes of DBS are tempered by the limited understanding of the response of neurons to applied electric fields and scientific definition of the therapeutic mechanisms of DBS remains elusive. In addition, it is presently unclear which electrode designs and stimulation parameters are optimal for maximum therapeutic benefit and minimal side effects. Detailed computer modeling of DBS has recently emerged as a powerful technique to enhance our understanding of the effects of DBS and to create a virtual testing ground for new stimulation paradigms. This review summarizes the fundamentals of neurostimulation modeling and provides an overview of some of the scientific contributions of computer models to the field of DBS. We then provide a prospective view on the application of DBS-modeling tools to augment the clinical utility of DBS and to design the next generation of DBS technology. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an increasingly used clinical treatment for various neurological disorders, particularly movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. However, the mechanism by which these high frequency electrical pulses act on neuronal activity is unclear. Once the stimulating electrode is placed in situ, an electrode-brain interface (EBI) is created. To compensate for the lack of studies on the effects of this generic depth EBI on therapeutic DBS, we constructed a three-dimensional computational model of the EBI using the finite element method, in which the structural details and biophysical properties of the EBI are preserved. Our investigations focus on the peri-electrode space as a significant element of the EBI, and its physiological and pathological modulation, in particular by brain pulsation and giant cell formation. We also consider the difference between the current fields induced by different configurations of the quadripolar electrode contacts. These results quantitatively demonstrated that the peri-electrode space is a significant element of the EBI and its biophysical properties are modulated by brain pulsation and giant cell formation, as well as by the choice of electrode contact configuration. This study leads to a fuller understanding of the EBI and its effects on the crossing electric currents, and will ultimately lead to optimisation of the therapeutic effects of DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Operative Neuromodulation is the field of altering electrically or chemically the signal transmission in the nervous system by implanted devices in order to excite, inhibit or tune the activities of neurons or neural networks and produce therapeutic effects. The present article reviews relevant literature on procedures or devices applied either in contact with the cerebral cortex or cranial nerves or in deep sites inside the brain in order to treat various refractory neurological conditions such as: a) chronic pain (facial, somatic, deafferentation, phantom limb), b) movement disorders (Parkinson's disease, dystonia, Tourette syndrome), c) epilepsy, d) psychiatric disease, e) hearing deficits, and f) visual loss. These data indicate that in operative neuromodulation, a new field emerges that is based on neural networks research and on advances in digitised stereometric brain imaging which allow precise localisation of cerebral neural networks and their relay stations; this field can be described as Neural networks surgery because it aims to act extrinsically or intrinsically on neural networks and to alter therapeutically the neural signal transmission with the use of implantable electrical or electronic devices. The authors also review neurotechnology literature relevant to neuroengineering, nanotechnologies, brain computer interfaces, hybrid cultured probes, neuromimetics, neuroinformatics, neurocomputation, and computational neuromodulation; the latter field is dedicated to the study of the biophysical and mathematical characteristics of electrochemical neuromodulation. The article also brings forward particularly interesting lines of research such as the carbon nanofibers electrode arrays for simultaneous electrochemical recording and stimulation, closed-loop systems for responsive neuromodulation, and the intracortical electrodes for restoring hearing or vision. The present review of cerebral neuromodulatory procedures highlights the transition from the conventional neurosurgery of resective or ablative techniques to a highly selective &amp;quot;surgery of networks&amp;quot;. The dynamics of the convergence of the above biomedical and technological fields with biological restorative approaches have important implications for patients with severe neurological disorders. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the previous paper in this series, basic mechanisms of electrode related injuries were discussed. In this paper, the discussion begins with some of the clinical aspects of burns. This is followed by a summary of the clinical literature on injuries produced by surface and subdermal electrodes. This clinical literature demonstrates that most electrode burns are related to the presence of high frequency electric fields (RF) created either by an electrosurgical unit or a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. A smaller number of lesions are produced by low current, long duration direct current (DC) stimulation and during high current stimulation such as defibrillation. A discussion of the clinical complications from indwelling intracranial electrodes centers on electrodes placed for deep brain stimulation (DBS) that are currently used therapeutically in a wide array of neurologic disorders. The probability of considering a post-implant MRI scan is high and the safety of such scans is the focus of discussion. A very small number of adverse incidents have indicated a downward revision in the specific absorption rate recommendations for MRI examination with those patients who present with indwelling DBS leads and internal pulse generators. Continued vigilance when any type of electrode is used is important. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECT: Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in patients with Parkinson disease is often very effective for treatment of debilitating motor symptoms. Nevertheless, the small size of the STN and its proximity to axonal projections results in multiple side effects during high-frequency stimulation. Contralateral eye deviation is produced in a small percentage of patients, but the precise mechanism of this side effect is at present poorly understood.METHODS: Contralateral eye deviation was produced by high-frequency stimulation of 22 contact sites in nine patients undergoing deep brain stimulation of the STN. The precise locations of these contacts were calculated and compiled in order to locate the stimulated structure responsible for eye deviation.RESULTS: The mean x, y, and z coordinates associated with contralateral eye deviation were found to be 11.57, 2.03, and 3.83 mm lateral, posterior, and inferior to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure midpoint, respectively. The point described by these coordinates is located within the lateral anterosuperior border of the STN.CONCLUSIONS: Given that stimulation of frontal eye field cortical regions produces similar contralateral conjugate eye deviation, these results are best explained by electrical current spread to nearby frontal eye field axons coursing lateral to the STN within the internal capsule. Thus, placement of the implanted electrode in a more medial, posterior, and inferior position may bring resolution of these symptoms by reducing the amount of current spread to internal capsule ax- </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Analysis of resurgent sodium-current expression in rat parahippocampal cortices and hippocampal formation. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The resurgent Na(+) current (I(NaR)) is a component of neuronal voltage-dependent Na(+) currents that is activated by repolarization and is believed to result from an atypical path of Na(+)-channel recovery from inactivation. So far, I(NaR) has only been identified in a small number of central neuronal populations in the cerebellum, diencephalon, and brainstem. The possible presence and roles of I(NaR) in neurons of the cerebral cortex and temporal-lobe memory system are still uncharacterized. In this study whole-cell, patch-clamp experiments were carried out in acute rat brain slices to investigate I(NaR) expression and properties in several neuronal populations of the parahippocampal region and hippocampal formation. Specifically, we examined pyramidal neurons of perirhinal cortex areas 36 and 35 (layers II and V); neurons of superficial and deep layers of medial entorhinal cortex (mEC); dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells; and pyramidal cells of the CA3 and CA1 hippocampal fields. I(NaR) was found to be thoroughly expressed in parahippocampal cortices. The most consistent and prominent I(NaR) expression was observed in mEC layer-II cells. A vast majority of areas 36 and 35 neurons (both in layers II and V) and mEC layer-III and -V neurons were also endowed with I(NaR), although at lower amplitude levels. I(NaR) was expressed by approximately 60% of DG granule cells and approximately 35% of CA1 pyramidal cells of the ventral hippocampus, whereas it was never observed in CA3 neurons (both in the ventral and dorsal hippocampus) and CA1 neurons of the dorsal hippocampus. The biophysical properties of I(NaR) were very similar in all of the neuronal types in which the current was observed, with a peak in the current-voltage relationship at -35/-40 mV. Our results show that the parahippocampal region and part of the hippocampal formation are sites of major I(NaR) expression, and provide a new basis for further studies on the molecular correlates of I(NaR). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the brain mechanisms of changing point of view (PoV) in a visuospatial memory task in 3D space. Eye movements were monitored and BOLD signal changes were measured while subjects were presented with 3D images of a virtual environment. Subjects were required to encode the position of a lamp in the environment and, after changing the PoV (angular difference varied from 0 degrees to 180 degrees in 45 degrees steps), to decide whether the lamp position had been changed too or not. Performance data and a scan-path analysis based on eye movement support the use of landmarks in the environment for coding lamp position and increasing spatial updating costs with increasing changes of PoV indicating allocentric coding strategies during all conditions (0 degrees - to 180 degrees -condition). Subtraction analysis using SPM revealed that a parieto-temporo-frontal network including left medial temporal areas was activated during this 3D visuospatial task, independent of angular difference. The activity of the left parahippocampal area and the left lingual gyrus (but not the hippocampus) correlated with increasing changes of the PoV between encoding and retrieval, emphasizing their specific role in spatial scene memory and allocentric coding. The results suggest that these areas are involved in a continuous matching process between internal representations of the environment and the external status quo. In addition, hippocampal activation correlated with performance was found indicating successful recall of spatial information. Finally, in a prefrontal area comprising, the so-called &amp;quot;deep&amp;quot; frontal eye field, activation was correlated with the amount of saccadic eye movements confirming its role in oculomotor processes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> To better understand the spatial extent of the direct effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on neurons, we implemented a geometrically realistic finite element electrical model incorporating anisotropic and inhomogenous conductivities. The model included the subthalamic nucleus (STN), substantia nigra (SN), zona incerta (ZI), fields of Forel H2 (FF), internal capsule (IC) and Medtronic 3387/3389 electrode. To quantify the effects of stimulation, we extended previous studies by using multi-compartment axon models with geometry and orientation consistent with anatomical features of the brain regions of interest. Simulation of axonal firing produced a map of relative changes in axonal activation. Voltage-controlled stimulation, with clinically typical parameters at the dorso-lateral STN, caused axon activation up to 4 mm from the target. This activation occurred within the FF, IC, SN and ZI with current intensities close to the average injected during DBS (3 mA). A sensitivity analysis of model parameters (fiber size, fiber orientation, degree of inhomogeneity, degree of anisotropy, electrode configuration) revealed that the FF and IC were consistently activated. Direct activation of axons outside the STN suggests that other brain regions may be involved in the beneficial effects of DBS when treating Parkinsonian symptoms. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Magnetic field perturbation of neural recording and stimulating microelectrodes. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> To improve the overall temporal and spatial resolution of brain mapping techniques, in animal models, some attempts have been reported to join electrophysiological methods with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, little attention has been paid to the image artefacts produced by the microelectrodes that compromise the anatomical or functional information of those studies. This work presents a group of simulations and MR images that show the limitations of wire microelectrodes and the potential advantages of silicon technology, in terms of image quality, in MRI environments. Magnetic field perturbations are calculated using a Fourier-based method for platinum (Pt) and tungsten (W) microwires as well as two different silicon technologies. We conclude that image artefacts produced by microelectrodes are highly dependent not only on the magnetic susceptibility of the materials used but also on the size, shape and orientation of the electrodes with respect to the main magnetic field. In addition silicon microelectrodes present better MRI characteristics than metallic microelectrodes. However, metallization layers added to silicon materials can adversely affect the quality of MR images. Therefore only those silicon microelectrodes that minimize the amount of metallic material can be considered MR-compatible and therefore suitable for possible simultaneous fMRI and electrophysiological studies. High resolution gradient echo images acquired at 2 T (TR/TE = 100/15 ms, voxel size = 100 x 100 x 100 microm3) of platinum-iridium (Pt-Ir, 90%-10%) and tungsten microwires show a complete signal loss that covers a volume significantly larger than the actual volume occupied by the microelectrodes: roughly 400 times larger for Pt-Ir and 180 for W, at the tip of the microelectrodes. Similar MR images of a single-shank silicon microelectrode only produce a partial volume effect on the voxels occupied by the probe with less than 50% of signal loss. </td>

More than 200 patients are still available for follow-up and therapeutical considerations. In this paper our experience is reviewed and pioneered fields are highlighted. The reported series of patients extends the use of deep brain stimulation beyond the field of Parkinson's disease to new fields such as cluster headache, disruptive behaviour, SUNCt, epilepsy and tardive dystonia. The low complication rate, the reversibility of the procedure and the available image guided surgery tools will further increase the therapeutic applications of DBS. New therapeutical applications are expected for this functional scalpel. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established therapy for the treatment of movement disorders, and has shown promising results for the treatment of a wide range of other neurological disorders. However, little is known about the mechanism of action of DBS or the volume of brain tissue affected by stimulation. We have developed methods that use anatomical and diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) data to predict the volume of tissue activated (VTA) during DBS. We co-register the imaging data with detailed finite element models of the brain and stimulating electrode to enable anatomically and electrically accurate predictions of the spread of stimulation. One critical component of the model is the DTI tensor field that is used to represent the 3-dimensionally anisotropic and inhomogeneous tissue conductivity. With this system we are able to fuse structural and functional information to study a relevant clinical problem: DBS of the subthalamic nucleus for the treatment of Parkinsons disease (PD). Our results show that inclusion of the tensor field in our model caused significant differences in the size and shape of the VTA when compared to a homogeneous, isotropic tissue volume. The magnitude of these differences was proportional to the stimulation voltage. Our model predictions are validated by comparing spread of predicted activation to observed effects of oculomotor nerve stimulation in a PD patient. In turn, the 3D tissue electrical properties of the brain play an important role in regulating the spread of neural activation generated by DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The H-coils are a novel development in transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), designed to achieve effective stimulation of deep neuronal regions without inducing unbearable fields cortically, thus broadly expanding the potential feasibility of TMS for research and for treating various neurologic disorders. This study compared the field distribution of two H-coil versions, termed H1 and H2, and of a standard figure-of-eight coil. Three-dimensional electrical field distributions of the H1 and H2-coils, designed for effective stimulation of prefrontal regions, and of a standard figure-8 coil, were measured in a head model filled with physiologic saline solution. With stimulator output at 120% of the hand motor threshold, suprathreshold field is induced by the H1-coil at lateral and medial frontal regions at depths of up to 4 to 5 cm, and by the H2-coil at medial prefrontal regions up to 2 to 3 cm, and at lateral frontal regions up to 5 to 6 cm. The figure-8 coil induced suprathreshold field focally under the coil's central segment, at depths of up to 1.5 cm. The ability of the H-coils to stimulate effectively deeper neuronal structures is obtained at the cost of a wider electrical field distribution in the brain. However, the H-coils enable simultaneous stimulation of several brain regions, whereas the depth penetration in each region can be controlled either by adjusting the stimulator output, and/or by varying the distance between various coil elements and the skull. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> There is a growing interest in the use of chronic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of medically refractory movement disorders and other neurological and psychiatric conditions. Fundamental questions remain about the physiologic effects of DBS. Previous basic research studies have focused on the direct polarization of neuronal membranes by electrical stimulation. The goal of this paper is to provide information on the thermal effects of DBS using finite element models to investigate the magnitude and spatial distribution of DBS-induced temperature changes. The parameters investigated include stimulation waveform, lead selection, brain tissue electrical and thermal conductivities, blood perfusion, metabolic heat generation during the stimulation and lead thermal conductivity/heat dissipation through the electrode. Our results show that clinical DBS protocols will increase the temperature of surrounding tissue by up to 0.8 degrees C depending on stimulation/tissue parameters. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Despite the clinical success of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for the treatment of movement disorders, many questions remain about its effects on the nervous system. This study presents a methodology to predict the volume of tissue activated (VTA) by DBS on a patient-specific basis. Our goals were to identify the intersection between the VTA and surrounding anatomical structures and to compare activation of these structures with clinical outcomes. The model system consisted of three fundamental components: (1) a 3D anatomical model of the subcortical nuclei and DBS electrode position in the brain, each derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); (2) a finite element model of the DBS electrode and electric field transmitted to the brain, with tissue conductivity properties derived from diffusion tensor MRI; (3) VTA prediction derived from the response of myelinated axons to the applied electric field, which is a function of the stimulation parameters (contact, impedance, voltage, pulse width, frequency). We used this model system to analyze the effects of subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS in a patient with Parkinson's disease. Quantitative measurements of bradykinesia, rigidity, and corticospinal tract (CST) motor thresholds were evaluated over a range of stimulation parameter settings. Our model predictions showed good agreement with CST thresholds. Additionally, stimulation through electrode contacts that improved bradykinesia and rigidity generated VTAs that overlapped the zona incerta/fields of Forel (ZI/H2). Application of DBS technology to various neurological disorders has preceded scientific characterization of the volume of tissue directly affected by the stimulation. Synergistic integration of clinical analysis, neuroimaging, neuroanatomy, and neurostimulation modeling provides an opportunity to address wide ranging questions on the factors linked with the therapeutic benefits and side effects of DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Intracellular recordings accompanied by dye fills were made from neurons associated with optic glomeruli in the lateral protocerebrum of the brain of the blowfly Phaenicia sericata. The present account describes the morphology of these cells and their electrophysiological responses to oriented bar motion. The most dorsal glomeruli are each supplied by retinotopic efferent neurons that have restricted dendritic fields in the lobula and lobula plate of the optic lobes. Each of these lobula complex cells represents a morphologically identified type of neuron arranged as an ensemble that subtends the entire monocular visual field. Of the four recorded and filled efferent types, three were broadly tuned to the orientation of bar stimuli. At the level of optic glomeruli a relay neuron extending centrally from optic foci and a local interneuron that arborizes among glomeruli showed narrow tuning to oriented bar motion. The present results are discussed with respect to the behavioral significance of oriented motion discrimination by flies and other insects, and with respect to neuroanatomical data demonstrating the organization of deep visual neuropils. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Objective.  The objective of this study was to report our observations on the external electromagnetic field influences on deep brain stimulation (DBS) in our patient population and how these influences affected our patients' lives and other healthcare-related conditions. Materials and Methods.  We have retrospectively analyzed data concerning the effects of external electromagnetic fields on 172 of our patients implanted with DBS. Results.  Identifiable electromagnetic sources turned the implantable pulse generator (IPG) off in 20 patients. In two patients, these episodes necessitated replacement of the Itrel II IPG (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) with the magnetically shielded Kinetra IPG (Medtronic Inc.). Six patients received cardiac pacemakers, leading, in two patients, to interference between the systems. Our experience concerning magnetic resonance imaging, electrocardiogram (ECG), heart defibrillation, electro-cautery, and other sources of electromagnetic interference also is described. Conclusions.  External electromagnetic interference may, in rare cases, constitute a severe threat to the well-being of the patient implanted with a DBS system. Also, malfunction of a DBS system may constitute a medical emergency. Nevertheless, in spite of these external electromagnetic influences, we consider DBS to be a safe method, provided safety protocols are followed, and provided that provider awareness about potential hazards is present. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: 1 - To assess the anatomical localization of the active contacts of deep brain stimulation targeted to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in Parkinson's disease patients. 2 - To analyze the stereotactic spatial distribution of the active contacts in relation to the dorsal and the ventral electrophysiologically-defined borders of the STN and the stereotactic theoretical target.METHODS: Twenty-eight patients underwent bilateral high-frequency stimulation of the STN (HFS-STN). An indirect anatomical method based on ventriculography coupled to electrophysiological techniques were used to localize the STN. Clinical improvement was evaluated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor score (UPDRS III). The normalized stereotactic coordinates of the active contact centres, dorsal and ventral electrophysiologically-defined borders of the STN were obtained from intraoperative X-rays images. These coordinates were represented in a three-dimensional stereotactic space and in the digitalized atlas of the human basal ganglia.RESULTS: HFS-STN resulted in significant improvement of motor function (62.8%) in off-medication state and levodopa-equivalent dose reduction of 68.7% (p &amp;lt; 0.05). Most of the active contacts (78.6%) were situated close to (+/- 1.6 mm) the dorsal border of the STN (STN-DB), while 16% were dorsal and 5.4% were ventral to it. Similar distribution was observed in the atlas. The euclidean distance between the STN-DB distribution center and the active contacts distribution center was 0.31 mm, while the distance between the active contacts distribution center and the stereotactic theoretical target was 2.15 mm. Most of the space defined by the active contacts distribution (53%) was inside that defined by the STN-DB distribution.CONCLUSION: In our series, most of the active electrodes were situated near the STN-DB. This suggests that HFS-STN could influence not only STN but also the dorsal adjacent structures (zona incerta and/or Fields of Forel). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although the therapeutic effect of deep brain stimulation (DBS) is well recognized, a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms responsible is still not known. In this study finite element method (FEM) modelling and simulation was used in order to study relative changes of the electrical field extension surrounding a monopolar DBS electrode positioned in grey matter. Due to the frequently appearing cystic cavities in the DBS-target globus pallidus internus, a nucleus of grey matter with and without a cerebrospinal fluid filled cystic cavity was modelled. The position, size and shape of the cyst were altered in relation to the electrode. The simulations demonstrated an electrical field around the active element with decreasing values in the radial direction. A stepwise change was present at the edge between grey and white matters. The cyst increased the radial extension and changed the shape of the electrical field substantially. The position, size and shape of the cyst were the main influencing factors. We suggest that cystic cavities in the DBS-target may result in closely related unexpected structures or neural fibre bundles being stimulated and could be one of the reasons for suboptimal clinical effects or stimulation-induced side effects. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Lesion or degeneration of the cerebellum can profoundly impair adaptive control of reaching in humans. Computational models have proposed that internal models that help control movements form in the cerebellum and influence planned motor output through the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. However, lesion studies of the cerebellar thalamus have not consistently found impairment in reaching or adaptation of reaching. To elucidate the role of the cerebellar thalamus in humans, we studied a group of essential tremor (ET) patients with deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes placed in the cerebellar thalamus. The stimulation can be turned on or off remotely and is thought to reduce tremor by blocking the spread of the pathological output from the cerebellum. We studied the effect of thalamic DBS on the ability to adapt arm movements to novel force fields. Although thalamic DBS resulted in a dramatic and significant reduction of tremor in ET, it also impaired motor adaptation: the larger the stimulation voltage, the greater the reduction in rates of adaptation. We next examined ET patients that had undergone unilateral thalamotomy in the cerebellar thalamus and found that adaptation with the contralateral arm was impaired compared with the ipsilateral arm. Therefore, although both lesion and electrical stimulation of the cerebellar thalamus are highly effective in reducing tremor, they significantly impair the ability of the brain to form internal models of action. Adaptive control of reaching appears to depend on the integrity of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECT: The parameter adjustment process during deep brain stimulation (DBS) for dystonia remains time consuming and based on clinical observation alone. The aim was to correlate the electric field with the GPi anatomy to be able to study the stimulated volume.METHODS: We developed a computer-assisted method (model) for visualizing electric field in reference to the stereotactic space. Electric field values were correlated with the GPi anatomy (stereotactic Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in one reference patient.RESULTS: Using this methodology it becomes possible to correlate the electric field distributions for patient specific parameters with the anatomical information. The application to one patient showed that the 0.1V/mm isofieldline fits best with the lateral GPi borders at the level of the stimulated contacts.CONCLUSIONS: The electric field is a crucial parameter as it is assumed to be responsible for triggering action potentials. Electric field visualisation allows the calculation of the stimulated volume for a given isoline. Its application to our whole patient population might help in determining a threshold for obtaining a therapeutic effect, to date unknown, and consequently in optimizing the parameter setting in each patient. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes are designed to stimulate specific areas of the brain. The most widely used DBS electrode has a linear array of 4 cylindrical contacts that can be selectively turned on depending on the placement of the electrode and the specific area of the brain to be stimulated. The efficacy of DBS therapy can be improved by localizing the current delivery into specific populations of neurons and by increasing the power efficiency through a suitable choice of electrode geometrical characteristics. We investigated segmented electrode designs created by sectioning each cylindrical contact into multiple rings. Prototypes of these designs, made with different materials and larger dimensions than those of clinical DBS electrodes, were evaluated in vitro and in simulation. A finite element model was developed to study the effects of varying the electrode characteristics on the current density and field distributions in an idealized electrolytic medium and in vitro experiments were conducted to measure the electrode impedance. The current density over the electrode surface increased towards the edges of the electrode, and multiple edges increased the non-uniformity of the current density profile. The edge effects were more pronounced over the end segments than over the central segments. Segmented electrodes generated larger magnitudes of the second spatial difference of the extracellular potentials, and thus required lower stimulation intensities to achieve the same level of neuronal activation as solid electrodes. For a fixed electrode conductive area, increasing the number of segments (edges) decreased the impedance compared to a single solid electrode, because the average current density over the segments increased. Edge effects played a critical role in determining the current density distributions, neuronal excitation patterns, and impedance of cylindrical electrodes, and segmented electrodes provide a means to increase the efficiency of DBS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A methodology is presented for placing deep brain stimulator electrodes under direct MR image guidance. The technique utilized a small, skull-mounted trajectory guide that is optimized for accurate alignment under MR fluoroscopy. Iterative confirmation scans are used to monitor device alignment and brain penetration. The methodology was initially tested in a human skull phantom and proved capable of achieving submillimeter accuracy over a set of 16 separate targets that were accessed. The maximum error that was obtained in this preliminary test was 2 mm, motivating use of the technique in a clinical study. Subsequently, a total of eight deep brain stimulation electrodes were placed in five patients. Satisfactory placement was achieved on the first pass in seven of eight electrodes, while two passes were required with one electrode. Mean error from the intended target on the first pass was 1.0 +/- 0.8 mm (range = 0.1-1.9 mm). All procedures were considered technical successes and there were no intraoperative complications; however, one patient did develop a postoperative infection. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Somatosensory and pain responses to direct intracerebral stimulations of the SII area were obtained in 14 patients referred for epilepsy surgery. Stimulations were delivered using transopercular electrodes exploring the parietal opercular cortex (SII area), the suprasylvian parietal cortex (SI area) and the insular cortex. SII responses were compared to those from adjacent SI and insular cortex. In the three areas we elicited mostly somatosensory responses, including paresthesiae, temperature and pain sensations. The rate of painful sensations (10%) was similar in SII and in the insula, while no painful sensation was evoked in SI. A few non-somatosensory responses were evoked by SII stimulation. Conversely various types of non-somatosensory responses (auditory, vegetative, vestibular, olfacto-gustatory, etc.) were evoked only by insular stimulation, confirming that SII, like SI, are mostly devoted to the processing of somatosensory inputs whereas the insular cortex is a polymodal area. We also found differences in size and lateralization of skin projection fields of evoked sensations between the three studied areas, showing a spatial resolution of the somatotopic map in SII intermediate between those found in SI and insula. This study shows the existence of three distinct somatosensory maps in the suprasylvian, opercular and insular regions, and separate pain representations in SII and insular cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation, the electric stimulation of basal ganglia nuclei, is a treatment for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. The underlying mechanisms are studied in animals, e.g. rodents. Designs and materials of commercially available microelectrodes, as well as experimentally applied driving signals vary tremendously. We used finite integration modeling to compare the electric field and current density distributions induced by various electrodes. Current density or field strength &amp;quot;hot spots&amp;quot;, which are located particularly at sites of high curvature and material interfaces coincided with corrosion and erosion at poles and insulation, respectively, as shown by scanning electron microscopy of stainless steel electrodes. Cell constants, i.e. geometry factors relating the electrode impedance to the specific medium conductivity, were calculated to determine the electrode voltage for a given stimulation current. Nevertheless, for electrodes of the same cell constant but of different geometry, current and field distributions may be very dissimilar. We found geometry-dependent limiting values of the stimulation current, above which electric tissue damage may occur. These values limit the reach of the stimulation signal for a given electrode geometry. Also, electrode geometries determine the shape of the stimulated tissue volume. This study provides tools for choosing the most appropriate geometry for targeting different-sized brain areas. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Coding of tactile response properties in the rat deep cerebellar nuclei. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the lateral hemispheres of the cerebellar cortex, somatosensory responses are represented in a finely grained fractured somatotopy. It is unclear, however, how these responses contribute to the ultimate output of the cerebellum from the deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN). Robust responses of DCN neurons to somatosensory stimuli have been described, but a detailed examination of their somatotopic arrangement and stimulus coding properties is lacking. To address these questions, we recorded extracellular, single-unit activity in the DCN of ketamine-anesthetized rats in response to air-puff stimuli aimed at six different orofacial and forelimb locations. In additional experiments, the duration and intensity of air-puff stimuli to the ipsilateral upper lip were systematically varied. Overall, we found that DCN neuron responses to air puff stimuli showed combinations of three distinct response components: a short-latency spike response, a pronounced inhibition, and a long-latency increase in firing. Individual neurons responsive to air-puff stimulation exhibited any combination of just one, two, or all three of these response components. The inhibitory response was most common and frequently consisted of a complete cessation of spiking despite a high spontaneous rate of baseline firing. In contrast to published findings from cerebellar cortical recordings, the receptive fields of all responsive neurons in the DCN were large. In fact, the receptive field of most neurons covered the ipsi- and contralateral face as well as forepaws. Response properties of individual neurons did not reliably indicate stimulus intensity or duration, although as a population DCN neurons showed significantly increasing response amplitudes as air-puff intensity or duration increased. Overall, the responses were characterized by a distinct temporal profile in each neuron, which remained unchanged with changes in stimulus condition. We conclude that the responses in the DCN of rats to air-puff stimuli differ substantially from cerebellar cortical responses in their receptive field properties and do not provide a robust code of tactile stimulus properties. Rather, the characteristic temporal response profile of each neuron may be tuned to control the timing of a specific task to which its output is linked. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The superior colliculus (SC) is a multimodal laminar structure located on the roof of the brain stem. The SC is a key structure in a distributed network of areas that mediate saccadic eye movements and shifts of attention across the visual field and has been extensively studied in nonhuman primates. In humans, it has proven difficult to study the SC with functional MRI (fMRI) because of its small size, deep location, and proximity to pulsating vascular structures. Here, we performed a series of high-resolution fMRI studies at 3 T to investigate basic visual response properties of the SC. The retinotopic organization of the SC was determined using the traveling wave method with flickering checkerboard stimuli presented at different polar angles and eccentricities. SC activations were confined to stimulation of the contralateral hemifield. Although a detailed retinotopic map was not observed, across subjects, the upper and lower visual fields were represented medially and laterally, respectively. Responses were dominantly evoked by stimuli presented along the horizontal meridian of the visual field. We also measured the sensitivity of the SC to luminance contrast, which has not been previously reported in primates. SC responses were nearly saturated by low contrast stimuli and showed only small response modulation with higher contrast stimuli, indicating high sensitivity to stimulus contrast. Responsiveness to stimulus motion in the SC was shown by robust activations evoked by moving versus static dot stimuli that could not be attributed to eye movements. The responses to contrast and motion stimuli were compared with those in the human lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results provide first insights into basic visual responses of the human SC and show the feasibility of studying subcortical structures using high-resolution fMRI. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Analysis of the synchronization mechanisms of neural activity is crucial to the understanding of the generation, propagation and control of epileptiform activity. Recently, phase synchronization (PS) analysis was applied to quantify the partial synchrony that exists in complex chaotic or noisy systems. In a previous study, we have shown that neural activity between two remotely located sites can be synchronized through a complete cut of the tissue by endogenous non-synaptic signals. Therefore, it should be possible to apply signals to control PS. In this study, we test the hypothesis that stimulation amplitudes below excitation level (sub-threshold) can be used to control phase synchronization of two neural signals and we investigate the underlying mechanisms. PS of neuronal activity is first analysed in two coupled Rossler neuron models. Both synchronization and desynchronization could be generated with sub-threshold sinusoidal stimulation. Phase synchronization was then studied in in vitro brain slices. Neuronal activity between two sites was modulated by the application of small sinusoidal electric fields. PS between two remote sites could be achieved by the application of two identical waveforms while phase desynchronization of two close sites was generated by the application of a stimulus at a single site. These results show that sub-threshold stimuli are able to phase synchronize or desynchronize two networks and suggest that small signals could play an important role in normal neural activity and epilepsy. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A sizeable number of spinothalamic tract axons terminate in the posterior thalamus. The functional roles and precise areas of termination of these axons have been a subject of recent controversy. The goals of this study were to identify spinothalamic tract neurons (STT) within the cervical enlargement that project to this area, characterize their responses to mechanical and thermal stimulation of their receptive fields, and use microantidromic tracking methods to determine the nuclei in which their axons terminate. Forty-seven neurons were antidromically activated using low-amplitude (&amp;lt; or =30 microA) current pulses in the contralateral posterior thalamus. The 51 points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were surrounded by ineffective tracks indicating that the surrounded axons terminated within the posterior thalamus. The areas of termination were located primarily in the posterior triangular, medial geniculate, posterior and posterior intralaminar, and suprageniculate nuclei. Recording points were located in the superficial and deep dorsal horn. The mean antidromic conduction velocity was 6.4 m/s, a conduction velocity slower than that of other projections to the thalamus or hypothalamus in rats. Cutaneous receptive fields appeared to be smaller than those of neurons projecting to other areas of the thalamus or to the hypothalamus. Each of the examined neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli. These findings indicate that the STT carries nociceptive information to several target nuclei within the posterior thalamus. We discuss the evidence that this projection provides nociceptive information that plays an important role in fear conditioning. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: The neuronal elements mediating the effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) are unknown. The objective was to determine the strength-duration properties of the neuronal elements that mediate paresthesias evoked by thalamic microstimulation.METHODS: The strength-duration properties of the neuronal elements causing paresthesias were measured using intraoperative microstimulation of the human thalamus. The sample included both concordant (reported in the same region as the mapped sensory receptive fields) and discordant paresthesias (reported in a region different than the mapped sensory receptive fields).RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the chronaxies of concordant and discordant paresthesias. There was no significant correlation between chronaxie and rheobase for concordant paresthesias, but a strong negative correlation existed for discordant paresthesias.CONCLUSIONS: Chronaxies did not distinguish the neuronal elements mediating concordant and discordant paresthesias, but correlations between chronaxie and rheobase suggest that concordant paresthesias were produced by activation of local cells while discordant paresthesias were caused by activation of axons of passage.SIGNIFICANCE: The similarity between the strength-duration properties of paresthesias evoked by thalamic stimulation, tremor reduction evoked by thalamic DBS, and EMG responses to thalamic DBS does not mean that these effects are caused by the same neural elements. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial magnetic stimulation of deep brain regions: evidence for efficacy of the H-coil. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Standard coils used in research and the clinic for noninvasive magnetic stimulation of the human brain are not capable of stimulating deep brain regions directly. As the fields induced by these coils decrease rapidly as a function of depth, only very high intensities would allow functional stimulation of deep brain regions and such intensities would lead to undesirable side effects. We have designed a coil based on numerical simulations and phantom brain measurements that allows stimulation of deeper brain regions, termed the Hesed coil (H-coil). In the present study we tested the efficacy and some safety aspects of the H-coil on healthy volunteers.METHODS: The H-coil was compared to a regular figure-8 coil in 6 healthy volunteers by measuring thresholds for activation of the abductor pollicis brevis (APB) representation in the motor cortex as a function of distance from each of the coils.RESULTS: The rate of decrease in the coil intensity as a function of distance is markedly slower for the H-coil. The motor cortex could be activated by the H-coil at a distance of 5.5 cm compared to 2 cm with the figure-8 coil.CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicate that the H-coil is likely to have the ability of deep brain stimulation and without the need of increasing the intensity to extreme levels that would cause a much greater stimulation in cortical regions.SIGNIFICANCE: The ability of non-invasive deep brain stimulation potentially opens a wide range of both research and therapeutic applications. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: A previous study showed no effect of 1Hz repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on tics in Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS). We modified the rTMS protocol in order to investigate some of the possible methodological reasons for the negative outcome in that study.METHODS: In a single blinded placebo-controlled cross-over study in five GTS patients without obsessive compulsive disorder we probed whether longer trains (1800 stimuli) of 1 Hz pre-motor cortex rTMS at 80% of active motor threshold and application to both hemispheres can improve tics in GTS. This was measured with the Yale Global Tic severity rating scale, the MOVES self-rating scale and video analysis.RESULTS: We found no significant effect of either left pre-motor cortex stimulation alone, or left pre-motor followed by right pre-motor cortex stimulation.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the rTMS protocol used in this study is not useful for the treatment of tics in GTS.SIGNIFICANCE: rTMS protocols need to be modified substantially in order to explore their potential for the treatment of tics in GTS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In this paper we report our experience with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for optic radiation (OR) visualization during resection of tumors. We hypothesize that intraoperative OR visualization helps to maintain patients' visual fields. DWI studies were performed together with T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in four patients with lesions in or adjacent to the OR (glioblastoma, oligo-astrocytoma, cavernoma, and metastasis; n = 1 each). The OR was identified from one of six DWI data acquisitions, segmented and reconstructed three-dimensionally. The image data were neuronavigationally transferred into the operative field, and provided the neurosurgeon with information on lesion site and adjacent OR localization. Preoperative and postoperative neuroophthalmological testing included, among others, perimetry to define the value of diffusion-weighted image guidance during OR lesion resection. Three lesions were removed completely. In one case, low-grade tumor parts infiltrating the OR were intentionally left. No persistent visual field deficits were induced. In one patient, a transient homonymous hemianopia attributable to postoperative swelling completely resolved under steroid medication. The authors conclude that intraoperative OR visualization, realized by neuronavigationally displayed DWI data, might prove to be helpful to maintain patients' visual fields. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Relationships between neuronal firing pattern and mechanosensory input in the deep dorsal horn were investigated using whole-cell recordings from isolated hamster spinal cord with innervation from an attached skin patch. Neurons that fired repetitively to depolarizing current (tonic cells) responded to both moving and static stimulation of their cutaneous receptive fields, and discharged continuously for the duration of stimulus application. Neurons responding to depolarizing current with transient, rapidly adapting firing (phasic cells) were significantly more responsive to stimulus movement than to static skin contact. Phasic cells typically issued a brief discharge at the onset or termination of a stimulus; their responses during static skin contact were weaker than tonic cells. Tonic cells were activated during both ramp and steady-state skin indentations, whereas phasic cells responded with their strongest excitation to displacement velocities exceeding 8 microm/ms. Mechanosensory input to phasic cells originated primarily from low threshold receptors, whereas tonic cells demonstrated a mixture of inputs from both low and high threshold sources. A third class of neurons responded to depolarizing current with a pronounced firing delay and displayed a sensitivity to cutaneous stimuli that was similar to tonic cells except they showed a modest decrease in firing as skin indentation velocity increased. The results suggest a correlation between functional properties of mechanoreceptive afferent fibers and intrinsic discharge properties of laminae III-V neurons that may significantly influence integration of cutaneous mechanosensory information at the first spinal relay. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> INTRODUCTION: Over the last few years, deep brain stimulation techniques, with targets such as the subthalamic nucleus or the pallidum, have bee found to be beneficial in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and dystonia. Conversely, therapeutic strategies of cortical stimulation have not yet been validated in these diseases, although they are known to be associated with various cortical dysfunctions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a valuable tool for non-invasive study of the role played by the motor cortex in the pathophysiology of movement disorders, in particular by assessing various cortical excitability determinants using single or paired pulse paradigms. In addition, repetitive TMS (rTMS) trains can be used to study the effects of transient activity changes of a targeted cortical area.BACKGROUND: Studies with TMS revealed significant motor cortex excitability changes, particularly regarding intracortical inhibitory pathways, both in Parkinson's disease and in dystonia, and these changes can be distinguished owing to the resting state or to the phases of movement preparation or execution. However, more specific correlation between electrophysiological features and clinical symptoms remains to be established. In addition, the stimulation of various cortical targets by rTMS protocols applied at low or high frequencies have induced some clear clinical effects.PERSPECTIVES: The TMS effects are and will remain applied in movement disorders to better understand the role played by the motor cortex, to assess various types of treatment and appraise the therapeutic potential of cortical stimulation.CONCLUSION: TMS provides evidence for motor cortex dysfunction in Parkinson's disease or dystonia. Moreover, rTMS results have opened new perspectives for therapeutic strategies of implanted cortical stimulation. By these both aspects, TMS techniques show their usefulness in the assessment of movement disorders. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> PURPOSE: To evaluate magnetic field interactions at 1.5- and 3-Tesla for implantable pulse generators (IPGs) and radiofrequency (RF) receivers used for implantable neurostimulation systems.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Measurements of magnetically induced displacement force and torque were determined for 10 devices (seven IPGs, three RF receivers) used for neurostimulation systems. Displacement force and torque were assessed at various positions in 1.5- and 3-Tesla MR systems using standardized techniques.RESULTS: Four IPGs exhibited force ratios (magnetic attraction force/device weight) greater than 1.0, with the overall magnitude of the force ratio increasing significantly when comparing the 1.5-Tesla to the 3-Tesla MR system. Of the seven IPGs tested, one exhibited a torque ratio (magnetic induced torque/product of the device weight and length) greater than 1.0. The RF receivers displayed relatively strong magnetic field interactions at both 1.5- and 3-Tesla, exhibiting force and torque ratios greater than 1.0.CONCLUSIONS: The neurostimulation implants tested exhibited varying degrees of magnetic field interactions, with four of the seven IPGs and the three RF receivers exhibiting at least one MR-induced force or torque value greater than the effect of gravity. These findings have important implications for patients with these implants who are referred for MRI examinations. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Facilitatory effect on the motor cortex by electrical stimulation over the cerebellum in humans. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electrical stimulation over the cerebellum is known to transiently suppress the contralateral motor cortex in humans. However, projections from the cerebellar nuclei to the primary motor cortex are disynaptic excitatory pathways through the ventral thalamus. In the present investigation we studied facilitatory effects on the motor cortical excitability elicited by electrical stimulation over the cerebellum by recording surface electromyographic (EMG) responses from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle in nine normal volunteers. For primary motor cortical activation magnetic stimuli were given over the contralateral hand motor area with a figure-of-eight shaped coil with a current to preferentially elicit I3-waves (test stimulus). For cerebellar stimulation high-voltage electric stimuli were given with an anode on the ipsilateral mastoid process and a cathode over the contralateral process as previously described (conditioning stimulus). The effect of conditioning-test interstimulus intervals was investigated. Anodal cerebellar stimuli increased the size of EMG responses to magnetic cortical stimulation at an interstimulus interval of 3 ms. Reversing the current of conditioning stimulus abolished the facilitation. The same (anodal) conditioning stimuli did not affect electrically evoked cortical responses. Based on the effective polarity of the conditioning stimulus and the time course of facilitation we consider that this effect is due to motor cortical facilitation elicited by activation of the excitatory dentatothalamocortical pathway at the deep cerebellar nuclei or superior cerebellar peduncle. We conclude that the motor cortical facilitation is evoked by cerebellar stimulation in humans. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The critical role of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the control of movement and parkinsonian symptoms is well established. Research in animals suggests that the cerebral cortex plays an important role in regulating the activity of the STN but this control is not known in humans. The most extensive cortical innervation of the STN originates from motor areas. Here, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) during intraoperative single-unit recordings from STN, in six patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) undergoing implantation of deep brain stimulators, to determine whether TMS of the motor cortex (MC) modulates the activity of STN and to investigate in vivo the functional organization of the corticosubthalamic circuit in the human brain. Single-pulse TMS of the MC induced an excitation in 74.9% of neurons investigated. This activation was followed by a long-lasting inhibition of the STN neuronal activity that did not correlate with PD severity. Responsive neurons to TMS of the hand area of motor cortex were located mainly in the lateral and dorsal region of the subthalamus while unresponsive cells had a prevalently medial distribution. This is the first report of TMS-induced modulation of STN neuronal activity in humans. These findings open up new avenues for in vivo studies of corticosubthalamic interactions in human brain and PD. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Quantifying movement disorders is becoming crucially important in neurosurgery units to evaluate the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions such as deep brain stimulation. Kinematic analysis, available for more than a century, may represent an adequate solution to this problem. However, quantifying movement disorders poses a number of technical problems. To help clinicians quantify movement disorders, the authors present data recorded in patients with dystonic syndromes and explore the question of movement &amp;quot;normality&amp;quot; in these patients when they receive deep brain stimulation of the internal globus pallidus. In particular, they show that when one control group (n = 11) and a group of dystonic patients (n = 11) are compared, it is possible to detect subtle changes in the performance of a double-handed finger to nose test. These differences persist in the absence of differences in the clinical evaluation of these patients. Suggestions regarding the compromises to make and pitfalls to avoid when quantifying movement disorders are discussed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We examined efferent connections of the cortical auditory field that receives thalamic afferents specifically from the suprageniculate nucleus (SG) and the dorsal division (MGD) of the medial geniculate body (MG) in the rat [Neuroscience 117 (2003) 1003]. The examined cortical region was adjacent to the caudodorsal border (4.8-7.0 mm posterior to bregma) of the primary auditory area (area Te1) and exhibited relatively late auditory response and high best frequency, compared with the caudal end of area Te1. On the basis of the location and auditory response property, the cortical region is considered identical to &amp;quot;posterodorsal&amp;quot; auditory area (PD). Injections of biocytin in PD revealed characteristic projections, which terminated in cortical areas and subcortical structures that play pivotal roles in directed attention and space processing. The most noticeable cortical terminal field appeared as dense plexuses of axons in area Oc2M, the posterior parietal cortex. Small terminal fields were scattered in area frontal cortex, area 2 that comprises the frontal eye field. The subcortical terminal fields were observed in the pontine nucleus, the nucleus of the brachium inferior colliculus, and the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus. Corticostriatal projections targeted two discrete regions of the caudate putamen: the top of the middle part and the caudal end. It is noteworthy that the inferior colliculus and amygdala virtually received no projection. Corticothalamic projections terminated in the MGD, the SG, the ventral zone of the ventral division of the MG, the ventral margin of the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), and the caudodorsal part of the posterior thalamic nuclear group (Po). Large terminals were found in the MGD, SG, LP and Po besides small terminals, the major component of labeling. The results suggest that PD is an auditory area that plays an important role in spatial processing linked to directed attention and motor function. The results extend to the rat findings from nonhuman primates suggesting the existence of a posterodorsal processing stream for auditory spatial perception. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Abnormal movements are not uncommon in childhood. Due to the severity of the abnormal movements or to the functional disability, a medical treatment is often required; the wide range of available pharmacological molecules and the absence of therapeutic consensus highlight the limited efficacy of the medical treatment on dystonic or athetoid movements, or severe tic disorders. The recent identification of the enzymatic defect implicated in metabolic diseases led to the development of specific treatment for newly recognized disorders, with more or less interesting results (creatine ou biotine supplementation). Recent progress in functional neurosurgery opened new fields in the treatment of movement disorders. Intrathecal baclofen was proved effective in the treatment of secondary dystonia, especially in patients with cerebral palsy. Deep brain stimulation is now an established therapy for patients with a generalized dystonic syndrome. Given the successful results of pallidal stimulation in dystonia, the indication of this procedure has been discussed in other types of abnormal movements. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with neurostimulation systems used for deep brain stimulation requires the utmost care, and no individual should undergo an MR examination in the absence of empirical evidence that the procedure can be performed safely. The risks of performing MRI in patients with neurostimulators include those associated with heating, magnetic field interactions, induced currents, and the functional disruption of these devices. The exact safety recommendations for the particular neurostimulation system with regard to the pulse generator, leads, electrodes, operational conditions for the device, the positioning of these components, and the MR system conditions must be carefully followed for MRI. As highlighted by 2 recent accidents, the failure to strictly follow safety recommendations (eg, use a 1.5-T MR system with a send/receive head radiofrequency coil only; limit the specific absorption rate to 0.4 W/kg; etc.) may result in serious, temporary, or permanent injury to the patient including the possibility of transient dystonia, paralysis, coma, or even death. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Current concepts of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the primary motor cortex are still under debate as to whether inhibitory motor effects are exclusively of cortical origin. To further elucidate a potential subcortical influence on motor effects, we combined TMS and unilateral subcortical electrical stimulation (SES) of the corticospinal tract. SES was performed through implanted depth electrodes in eight patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) for severe dystonia. Chronaxie, conduction velocity (CV) of the stimulated fibres and poststimulus time histograms of single motor unit recordings were calculated to provide evidence of an activation of large diameter myelinated fibres by SES. Excitatory and inhibitory motor effects recorded bilaterally from the first dorsal interosseus muscle were measured after SES and focal TMS of the motor cortex. This allowed us to compare motor effects of subcortical (direct) and cortical (mainly indirect) activation of corticospinal neurons. SES activated a fast conducting monosynaptic pathway to the alpha motoneuron. Motor responses elicited by SES had significantly shorter onset latency and shorter duration of the contralateral silent period compared to TMS induced motor effects. Spinal excitability as assessed by H-reflex was significantly reduced during the silent period after SES. No ipsilateral motor effects could be elicited by SES while TMS was followed by an ipsilateral inhibition. The results suggest that SES activated the corticospinal neurons at the level of the internal capsule. Comparison of SES and TMS induced motor effects reveals that the first part of the TMS induced contralateral silent period should be of spinal origin while its later part is due to cortical inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, the present results suggest that the ipsilateral inhibition is predominantly mediated via transcallosal pathways. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> AIMS: Subthalamic deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) improves motor symptoms and quality of life (QOL). Because depression is a potent correlate of QOL, and STN-DBS may be associated with changes in mood, this study sought to determine whether QOL improvement is a direct or indirect consequence of motor improvement.METHODS: 26 patients with PD, free of dementia and major depression, who consecutively underwent bilateral, microelectrode-guided STN-DBS, underwent preoperative and 3-month postoperative neuropsychological evaluation, including measures of QOL (PD Questionnaire -39) and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory).RESULTS: Motor score in the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS Part III) improved significantly with STN-DBS relative to preoperative 'on' and 'off' scores, as did QOL and depressive symptoms. Extent of QOL improvement tended to be associated with improvement in motor score from presurgical on to postsurgical on stimulation and on medication state. QOL improvement was significantly related to amelioration of depressive symptoms. Partial correlations revealed that the association between QOL improvement and depression remained significant when influence of motor improvement on QOL and depression was controlled for. The motor-QOL association was no longer significant when effects of depression were controlled for.CONCLUSIONS: Significant QOL improvements after STN-DBS are associated with improved motor 'on' state and depressive symptoms. The influence of motor improvement on QOL may be largely indirect by reducing depression. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We recorded from neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) while monkeys performed a novel direction discrimination task. In contrast to the task we used previously, the new version required the monkey to dissociate perceptual judgments from preparation to execute specific operant saccades. The monkey discriminated between 2 opposed directions of motion in a random-dot motion stimulus and was required to maintain the decision in memory throughout a delay period before the target of the required operant saccade was revealed. We hypothesized that perceptual decisions made in this paradigm would be represented in an &amp;quot;abstract&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;categorical&amp;quot; form within the brain, probably in the frontal cortex, and that decision-related neural activity would be eliminated from spatially organized preoculomotor structures such as the SC. To our surprise, however, a small population of neurons in the intermediate and deep layers of the SC fired in a choice-specific manner early in the trial well before the monkey could plan the operant saccade. Furthermore, the representation of the decision during the delay period appeared to be spatial: the active region in the SC map corresponded to the region of space toward which the perceptually discriminated stimulus motion flowed. Electrical microstimulation experiments suggested that these decision-related SC signals were not merely related to covert saccade planning. We conclude that monkeys may employ, in part, a spatially referenced mnemonic strategy for representing perceptual decisions, even when an abstract, categorical representation might appear more likely a priori. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease dissociates mood and motor circuits: a functional MRI case study. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Behavioral disturbances have been reported with subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) treatment in Parkinson's disease (PD). We report correlative functional imaging (fMRI) of mood and motor responses induced by successive right and left DBS. A 36-year-old woman with medically refractory PD and a history of clinically remitted depression underwent uncomplicated implantation of bilateral STN DBS. High-frequency stimulation of the left electrode improved motor symptoms. Unexpectedly, right DBS alone elicited several reproducible episodes of acute depressive dysphoria. Structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) imaging was carried out with sequential individual electrode stimulation. The electrode on the left was within the inferior STN, whereas the right electrode was marginally superior and lateral to the intended STN target within the Fields of Forel/zona incerta. fMRI image analysis (Analysis of Functional NeuroImages, AFNI) contrasting OFF versus ON stimulation identified significant lateralized blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal changes with DBS (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Left DBS primarily showed changes in motor regions: increases in premotor and motor cortex, ventrolateral thalamus, putamen, and cerebellum as well as decreases in sensorimotor/supplementary motor cortex. Right DBS showed similar but less extensive change in motor regions. More prominent were the unique increases in superior prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate (Brodmann's area [BA] 24), anterior thalamus, caudate, and brainstem, and marked widespread decreases in medial prefrontal cortex (BA 9/10). The mood disturbance resolved spontaneously in 4 weeks despite identical stimulation parameters. Transient depressive mood induced by subcortical DBS stimulation was correlated with changes in mesolimbic cortical structures. This case provides new evidence supporting cortical segregation of motor and nonmotor cortico-basal ganglionic systems that may converge in close proximity at the level of the STN and the adjacent white matter tracts (Fields of Forel/zona incerta). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A multishot partial-k-space EPI technique is presented and validated by fMRI at high spatial resolution. High-resolution phase maps corrected by phase-encoded reference scans have less off-resonance effects. Phantom studies demonstrate that this method can substantially improve partial-k-space EPI image formation. BOLD fMRI at submillimeter spatial resolution (156 x 156 x 2000 microm(3), 0.049 microl) was achieved in a rat whisker barrel stimulation model using this technique. The study included eight rats, five of which were administered an intravascular contrast agent (monocrystalline iron oxide nanocolloid (MION)) after the BOLD experiments. In two rats the highest BOLD responses were in the deep layers (IV-VI), and in six rats the highest responses were on the surface and in the deep cortical layers. Most of the pixels that exhibited high BOLD responses had high blood volume weightings. The benefits of this technique are expected to increase for high-resolution fMRI at higher magnetic fields, where T(2) (*) is shorter. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neural activity in the optic tectum was compared with activity in the nucleus isthmi (NI) of both goldfish and sunfish with the aim of understanding how the two brain structures interact to process visual information. The two species yielded very similar results. Superficial tectum responds reliably to visual stimulation with topographically organized receptive fields; deep tectum and NI respond to stimulation throughout the field of the contralateral eye and habituate rapidly. Bursts of large-amplitude spiking in NI occur spontaneously and in response to contralateral visual stimulation. These NI bursts correlate with activity bursts across the tectal lobe on the same side, especially in the deeper layers. NI bursts may also synchronize with spiking activity in deep tectum. Trains of small-amplitude spikes in NI can be elicited by both ipsilateral and contralateral stimulation, but are not reflected in tectal activity. Simultaneous recordings from two sites in one NI were almost identical, suggesting that NI operates as a functional unit, broadcasting the same message across the ipsilateral tectal lobe. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> INTRODUCTION: While it is desirable to perform MRI examinations in patients with deep brain stimulators (DBS), a major safety concern exists regarding the potential for excessive heating secondary to magnetically induced electrical currents. This study was designed to determine the safety of MRI and DBS.METHODS: Standard configurations of DBS systems were tested. In vitro testing was performed using a 1.5-Tesla MR system, a gel-filled phantom, and the body and head RF coils with varying levels of RF energy (SAR). A fluoroptic thermometry system was used to record temperatures.RESULTS: Using the 1.5-T MRI and body RF transmit coil, the temperature changes ranged from 2.5 to 25.3 degrees C. Using the 1.5-T MRI and head RF transmit coil, the temperature changes ranged from 2.3 to 7.1 degrees C.CONCLUSIONS: Excessive heating does occur with certain MR imaging conditions. Under certain conditions determined in this study, patients with DBS may safely undergo anatomical MR imaging. In the future, standardized testing and more comprehensive studies will be needed to ensure the MR safety of neurostimulation systems. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is unique among the current brain stimulation techniques because it is relatively non-invasive. TMS markedly differs from vagus nerve stimulation, deep brain stimulation and magnetic seizure therapy, all of which require either an implanted prosthesis or general anesthesia, or both. Since its rebirth in its modern form in 1985, TMS has already shown potential usefulness in at least three important domains-as a basic neuroscience research instrument, as a potential clinical diagnostic tool, and as a therapy for several different neuropsychiatric conditions. The TMS scientific literature has now expanded beyond what a single summary article can adequately cover. This review highlights several new developments in combining TMS with functional brain imaging, using TMS as a psychiatric therapy, potentially using TMS to enhance performance, and finally recent advances in the core technology of TMS. TMS' ability to non-invasively and focally stimulate the brain of an awake human is proving to be a most important development for neuroscience in general, and neuropsychiatry in particular. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus in Parkinson's disease: evaluation of active electrode contacts. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: The subthalamic nucleus is the preferred target for deep brain stimulation in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The site of permanent stimulation is the subject of ongoing debate, as stimulation both within and adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus may be effective.OBJECTIVE: To assess the position of active electrode contacts in relation to the dorsal margin of the subthalamic nucleus as determined by intraoperative microrecordings and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).METHODS: In 25 patients suffering from severe levodopa sensitive parkinsonism, deep brain stimulating electrodes (n = 49) were implanted following mapping of the subthalamic nucleus by microrecording and microstimulation along five parallel tracks. Postoperative stereotactic radiography and fusion of pre- and postoperative MRI studies were used to determine the stereotactic position relative to the midcommissural point of the most effective electrode contacts selected for permanent stimulation (n = 49). Intraoperative microrecordings were analysed retrospectively to define the dorsal margin of the subthalamic nucleus. In cases where the dorsal margin could be defined in at least three microrecording tracks (n = 37) it was correlated with the position of the active contact using an algorithm developed for direct three dimensional comparisons.RESULTS: Stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus resulted in marked improvement in levodopa sensitive parkinsonian symptoms and levodopa induced dyskinesias, with significant improvement in UPDRS III scores. In several instances, projection of the electrode artefacts onto the T2 weighted MRI visualised subthalamic nucleus of individual patients suggested that the electrodes had passed through the subthalamic nucleus. When the actual position of active electrode contacts (n = 35) was correlated with the dorsal margin of the subthalamic nucleus as defined neurophysiologically, most contacts were located either in proximity (+/- 1.0 mm) to the dorsal border of the subthalamic nucleus (32.4%) or further dorsal within the subthalamic region (37.8%). The other active contacts (29.7%) were detected within the dorsal (sensorimotor) subthalamic nucleus. The average position of all active contacts (n = 49) was 12.8 mm (+/- 1.0) lateral, 1.9 mm (+/- 1.4) posterior, and 1.6 mm (+/- 2.1) ventral to the midcommissural point.CONCLUSIONS: Subthalamic nucleus stimulation appears to be most effective in the border area between the upper subthalamic nucleus (sensorimotor part) and the subthalamic area containing the zona incerta, fields of Forel, and subthalamic nucleus projections. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> A comparative, computational study of the modeling of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is presented using a human head model. The magnetic fields from a typical TMS coil of figure-eight type is modeled using the Biot-Savart law. The TMS coil is placed in a position used clinically for treatment of depression. Induced current densities and electric field distributions are calculated in the model using the impedance method. The calculations are made using driving currents and wave forms typical in the clinical setting. The obtained results are compared and contrasted with the corresponding ECT results. In the ECT case, a uniform current density is injected on one side of the head and extracted from the equal area on the opposite side of the head. The area of the injected currents corresponds to the electrode placement used in the clinic. The currents and electric fields, thus, produced within the model are computed using the same three-dimensional impedance method as used for the TMS case. The ECT calculations are made using currents and wave forms typical in the clinic. The electrical tissue properties are obtained from a 4-Cole-Cole model. The numerical results obtained are shown on a two-dimenaional cross section of the model. In this study, we find that the current densities and electric fields in the ECT case are stronger and deeper penetrating than the corresponding TMS quantities but both methods show biologically interesting current levels deep inside the brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Reduced influence of the ipsilateral ear on spatial tuning of auditory neurons in the albino superior colliculus: a knock-on effect of anomalies of the acoustic chiasm? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Auditory brainstem abnormalities affecting decussation patterns and nuclei involved in the acoustic chiasm exist in a variety of albino mammals, suggesting that binaural processes underlying spatial hearing may be disrupted in these mutants. To evaluate this we have compared the contribution of the two ears in albino and normally pigmented guinea pigs to the spatial tuning of auditory neurons in the deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC). Broadband noise stimuli at threshold and at suprathreshold intensities were presented from different azimuthal loudspeaker locations under free-field anechoic conditions, and auditory receptive fields were plotted before, during and after occluding the ipsilateral ear. We show that the deep layers of the albino SC contain a map of contralateral auditory azimuth along its anteroposterior axis, which is aligned with the visual map in the superficial layers above, just as in normal animals. We also show that threshold spatial responses are elicited only via the contralateral ear and at similar stimulus intensities (mean approximately 30 dB SPL) in the two pigmentation phenotypes. The mechanisms that maintain spatial tuning at sound intensities of 10-40 dB above threshold, however, differ markedly in these animals. Plugging the ipsilateral ear in normal guinea pigs caused significant expansions of their auditory receptive fields and loss of directional tuning, but in the albinos occlusion had little effect on these spatial properties. The results suggest that while spatial selectivity for relatively loud sounds among SC neurons is normally maintained via the binaural combination of contralateral excitatory drive and ipsilateral inhibition, it is achieved in albinos almost exclusively by monaural input from the contralateral ear. This finding is consistent with an excessive contralateral ear dominance of higher levels of the albino auditory system caused by anomalies of their acoustic chiasm, analogous to the monocular dominance of the visual system that results from excessive axon crossing at the optic chiasm in these animals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Increased responses in trigeminocervical nociceptive neurons to cervical input after stimulation of the dura mater. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Pain referral and spread in headache patients may be attributed to a sensitization of central nociceptive neurons with an increased excitability to afferent input. We investigated if noxious dural stimulation evokes sensitization of second-order neurons that leads to an increased responsiveness to stimulation of cervical afferents. Recordings were made from 29 nociceptive neurons in the C2 dorsal horn of the rat that received convergent synaptic input from trigeminal and cervical afferents. Trigeminal afferents of the supratentorial dura mater were activated by mustard oil (MO) and the responses of second-order neurons to stimulation of the greater occipital nerve (GON) were studied before and after dural stimulation. Projection sites to the contralateral thalamus were determined by antidromic stimulation. After dural application with MO, mechanical thresholds of the dura significantly decreased (P &amp;lt; 0.05) and an enlargement of the trigeminal and cervical cutaneous mechanoreceptive fields was observed in 71% of neurons. The responses to noxious mechanical stimulation of deep paraspinal muscles increased after MO application (P &amp;lt; 0.001). Similarly, an increase in the excitability to electrical stimulation of the GON was observed in C-fibre responses (P &amp;lt; 0.001). These results suggest that stimulation of nociceptive afferent C-fibres of the dura mater leads to a sensitization of second-order neurons receiving cervical input. This mechanism might be involved in the referral of pain from trigeminal to cervical structures and might contribute to the clinical phenomena of cervical hypersensitivity in migraine and cluster headache. Understanding this interaction is likely to be pivotal in characterizing the physiology of treatment with manipulations involving cervical input, such as GON injection. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The present study sought to identify predictors of cognitive decline after thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor (ET). Twenty-seven patients (55%) with ET demonstrated mild cognitive decrements relative to pre-surgical baseline (ET-D), whereas 22 patients (45%) were classified as neuropsychologically stable (ET-S). The ET-D and ET-S groups were comparable in terms of baseline demographic, disease, and neuropsychological characteristics, as well as post-surgical motor outcomes. However, the ET-D group had significantly higher pulse width (PW) stimulator settings, and a greater proportion of ET-D than ET-S patients underwent left in comparison to right thalamic stimulation. A subsequent step-wise discriminant function analysis revealed that disease onset after age 37 years and higher PW settings (&amp;gt;or=120 micros) were the strongest predictors of post-surgical cognitive decline in this sample. Findings indicate that although relatively higher PW settings might afford optimal tremor control in some patients, the corresponding risk of mild, probably often subclinical, cognitive morbidity must be weighed accordingly. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electromagnetic interference of GSM mobile phones with the implantable deep brain stimulator, ITREL-III. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: The purpose was to investigate mobile phone interference with implantable deep brain stimulators by means of 10 different 900 Mega Hertz (MHz) and 10 different 1800 MHz GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) mobile phones.METHODS: All tests were performed in vitro using a phantom especially developed for testing with deep brain stimulators. The phantom was filled with liquid phantom materials simulating brain and muscle tissue. All examinations were carried out inside an anechoic chamber on two implants of the same type of deep brain stimulator: ITREL-III from Medtronic Inc., USA.RESULTS: Despite a maximum transmitted peak power of mobile phones of 1 Watt (W) at 1800 MHz and 2 W at 900 MHz respectively, no influence on the ITREL-III was found. Neither the shape of the pulse form changed nor did single pulses fail. Tests with increased transmitted power using CW signals and broadband dipoles have shown that inhibition of the ITREL-III occurs at frequency dependent power levels which are below the emissions of GSM mobile phones. The ITREL-III is essentially more sensitive at 1800 MHz than at 900 MHz. Particularly the frequency range around 1500 MHz shows a very low interference threshold.CONCLUSION: These investigations do not indicate a direct risk for ITREL-III patients using the tested GSM phones. Based on the interference levels found with CW signals, which are below the mobile phone emissions, we recommend similar precautions as for patients with cardiac pacemakers: 1. The phone should be used at the ear at the opposite side of the implant and 2. The patient should avoid carrying the phone close to the implant. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Vagal input to lateral area 3a in cat cortex. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Penfield's sensory homunculus included visceral organs at its lateral extreme, and vagal input was recently identified lateral to the intraoral representation in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) of rats. We tested whether vagal input is similarly located in cats where area 3b (equivalent to S1) is clearly distinguishable from adjacent regions. Field potentials were recorded from the intact dura over the left hemisphere using electrical stimulation of the left or right cervical vagus nerve in seven cats. A surface positive-negative potential was evoked from either side in the lateral part of the sigmoid gyrus. Finer mapping made at the pial surface with a microelectrode identified a focal site anteromedial to the anterior tip of the coronal sulcus. Depth recordings demonstrated polarity reversals and multi-unit vagal responses, indicating that the potentials were generated by an afferent activation focus in the middle layers of the cortex. The S1 mechanoreceptive representation was localized by mapping multi-unit somatosensory receptive fields in the middle cortical layers near the coronal sulcus. The vagal-evoked potential site was distinctly anterior to the intraoral S1 representation and adjacent to the masseteric-nerve-evoked potential focus. Lesions made at the focal site revealed that this site is cytoarchitectonically located in area 3a not area 3b. Thus vagal input to the sensorimotor cortex in cats resembles deep rather than cutaneous somatic input, similar to the localization of nociceptive-specific input to area 3a in monkeys. The possibilities are considered that this vagal input is involved in motor control and in the sensory experience of visceral afferent activity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Experiments were performed to assess the excitability of neural elements activated while inducing saccadic eye movements electrically from different cortical layers of striate cortex (area V1) in rhesus monkeys. Excitability was assessed by measuring current thresholds, saccadic latencies, chronaxies, and the effectiveness of anode-first vs. cathode-first pulses. Minimum current thresholds for the evocation of saccades (i.e. less than 5 microA) were observed when the deepest layers of V1 were stimulated. The shortest saccadic latencies were also observed at these depths. The shortest latency at 10 times the threshold current was 49 ms on average. The chronaxies of the elements mediating saccades were less in deep V1 (i.e. 0.17 ms) than in superficial V1 (i.e. 0.23 ms). Anode-first pulses were more effective at evoking saccades from superficial V1, whereas cathode-first pulses were more effective at evoking saccades from deep V1. These results indicate that the excitability properties of superficial and deep V1 are distinct for the generation of saccades. Moreover, the excitability of elements mediating saccades in V1 of monkeys is comparable to that of elements mediating phosphenes in human V1. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the one year cognitive, mood state, and quality of life (QoL) outcomes of unilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) for essential tremor (ET).METHODS: 40 patients diagnosed with ET completed comprehensive neuropsychological assessments about one month before and three and 12 months after DBS electrode implantation. Data were subjected to multivariate analyses, and significant results were further analysed using univariate techniques.RESULTS: Analyses revealed statistically significant improvements on a cognitive screening measure and in aspects of fine visuomotor and visuoperceptual functions, verbal memory, mood state, and QoL. No group-wise declines in cognition were observed, but more patients showed declines than improvements on language and visual memory tests. Semantic verbal fluency declined significantly in four (10%) of the patients. In these four patients, diminished lexical verbal fluency was present at baseline.CONCLUSION: Cognitive, mood, and QoL outcomes after one year of DBS for ET are favourable; there were no overall deleterious effects on cognition, and DBS was accompanied by a significant reduction in anxiety and improvements in quality of life. However, preoperative verbal fluency diminution may predispose to further fluency declines after DBS. </td>

All the pathologies are covered, from lumbar disc hernia to intracranial tumors and vascular malformations. But the originality stays into the exceptional environment by the concentration of logistic resources and the ability of clinician and researchers who daily collaborate with the neurosurgical team. The Department of Neurosurgery has a strong reputation in several fields like intraspinal cord tumors or Pet-guided Neurosurgery in stereotactic biopsies, neuronavigation and Gamma Knife and, generally speaking, in the original approach of the treatment and follow-up of brain tumors. Neurodegenerative diseases also benefit of modern approaches trough the Gamma Knife, deep brain stimulation or fetal cell grafting into the brain in Parkinson and soon in Huntington diseases. Last but not least, the arrival for the 25th anniversary of Erasme Hospital of an interventional MRI will allow to follow in real-time the resection of brain tumors with an obvious benefit for the surgical performances and the quality of life of the patients. It will also open a new window for neurosurgical research through combination with functional MRI and Pet-Scan, reinforcing the reputation of Erasme Neurosurgical Department who has been distinguished in 1997 by the World Health Organisation as &amp;quot;WHO Collaborating Center for Research and Training in Neurosurgery&amp;quot; and nominated again in 2002 for a new 4-year period, which is unique in the Neurosurgical World. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Local suppression of epileptiform activity by electrical stimulation in rat hippocampus in vitro. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> High frequency electrical stimulation of deep brain structures (DBS) has been effective at controlling abnormal neuronal activity in Parkinson's patients and is now being applied for the treatment of pharmacologically intractable epilepsy. The mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of DBS are unknown. In particular, the effect of the electrical stimulation on neuronal firing remains poorly understood. Previous reports have showed that uniform electric fields with both AC (continuous sinusoidal) or DC waveforms could suppress epileptiform activity in vitro. In the present study, we tested the effects of monopolar electrode stimulation and low-duty cycle AC stimulation protocols, which more closely approximate those used clinically, on three in vitro epilepsy models. Continuous sinusoidal stimulation, 50 % duty-cycle sinusoidal stimulation, and low (1.68 %) duty-cycle pulsed stimulation (120 micros, 140 Hz) could completely suppress spontaneous low-Ca2+ epileptiform activity with average thresholds of 71.11 +/- 26.16 microA, 93.33 +/- 12.58 microA and 300 +/- 100 microA, respectively. Continuous sinusoidal stimulation could also completely suppress picrotoxin- and high-K+-induced epileptiform activity with either uniform or localized fields. The suppression generated by the monopolar electrode was localized to a region surrounding the stimulation electrode. Potassium concentration and transmembrane potential recordings showed that AC stimulation was associated with an increase in extracellular potassium concentration and neuronal depolarization block; AC stimulation efficacy was not orientation-selective. In contrast, DC stimulation blocked activity by membrane hyperpolarization and was orientation-selective, but had a lower threshold for suppression. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Saccadic reaction times to visual targets tend to be faster when non-visual stimuli are presented in close temporal or spatial proximity even if subjects are instructed to ignore the accessory input. The effect tends to decrease with increasing spatial distance between the stimuli. Multisensory interaction effects measured in neural structures involved in saccade generation have demonstrated a similar spatial dependence. The present study investigated visual-tactile interaction effects on saccadic reaction time using a focused attention paradigm. Compared to unimodal visual targets saccadic reaction time to bimodal stimuli was reduced by up to 30 ms. The effect was larger for ipsi- than for contralateral presentations, and it increased with the eccentricity of the visual target. The results are consistent with attributing part of the facilitation to a multisensory effect of bimodal neurons with overlapping visual and tactile receptive field structures in the deep layers of the superior colliculus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is still contraindicated in patients with implanted active medical devices, as the applied radiofrequency (RF) fields can lead to significant heating of the implants and the electrodes. A head model with an implanted deep brain stimulation electrode (DBS) was exposed to a continuous RF-field similar to the excitational field used in MRI at a frequency of 64 MHz. In this study a two-step procedure for the accurate estimation of electrode-heating during MRI is presented. First the energy loss was calculated in the frequency domain during an applied RF-pulse. Then a thermodynamic algorithm taking heat transfer mechanisms into account was used. The applied method showed to be numerically stable and gave more accurate results than first calculated using a simple worst-case approximation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Declines in verbal fluency are consistently reported in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) after pallidal surgery. In the present study, the clustering and switching components of semantic or category fluency (oral naming of items obtainable in supermarkets) were examined at baseline and four months after unilateral deep brain stimulation or pallidotomy in 45 patients with PD (30 left, 15 right pallidal surgery). Post-operative declines were observed for supermarket fluency total score and switching, but not for average cluster size. These findings support the proposal that semantic fluency decrements after pallidal surgery reflect a disruption of frontal-basal ganglia circuits mediating efficient shifting between semantic categories, or perhaps efficient access to categories, rather than a degradation of semantic stores. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECT: The subthalamic nucleus (STN) is a target in the surgical treatment of Parkinson disease (PD). Little is known about the neurons within the human STN that modulate movement. The authors' goal was to examine the distribution of movement-related neurons within the STN of humans by using microelectrode recording to identify neuronal receptive fields.METHODS: Data were retrospectively collected from microelectrode recordings that had been obtained in 38 patients with PD during surgery for placement of STN deep brain stimulation electrodes. The recordings had been obtained in awake, nonsedated patients. Antiparkinsonian medications were withheld the night before surgery. Neuronal discharges were amplified, filtered, and displayed on an oscilloscope and fed to an audio monitor. The receptive fields were identified by the presence of reproducible, audible changes in the firing rate that were time-locked to the movement of specific joint(s). The median number of electrode tracks per patient was six (range two-nine). The receptive fields were identified in 278 (55%) of 510 STN neurons studied. One hundred one tracks yielded receptive field data. Fourteen percent of 64 cells tested positive for face receptive fields, 32% of 687 cells tested positive for upper-extremity receptive fields, and 21% of 242 cells tested positive for lower-extremity receptive fields. Sixty-eight cells (24%) demonstrated multiple-joint receptive fields. Ninety-three cells (65%) with movement-related receptive fields were located in the dorsal half of the STN, and 96.8% of these were located in the rostral two thirds of the STN. Analysis of receptive field locations from pooled data and along individual electrode tracks failed to reveal a consistent somatotopic organization.CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study demonstrate a regional compartmentalization of neurons with movement-related receptive fields within the STN, supporting the existence of specific motor territories within the STN in patients suffering from PD. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECT: The authors sought to determine the location of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes that were most effective in treating Parkinson disease (PD).METHODS: Fifty-four DBS electrodes were localized in and adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus (STN) postoperatively by using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in a series of 29 patients in whom electrodes were implanted for the treatment of medically refractory PD, and for whom quantitative clinical assessments were available both pre- and postoperatively. A novel MR imaging sequence was developed that optimized visualization of the STN. The coordinates of the tips of these electrodes were calculated three dimensionally and the results were normalized and corrected for individual differences by using intraoperative neurophysiological data (mean 5.13 mm caudal to the midcommissural point [MCP], 8.46 mm inferior to the anterior commissure-posterior commissure [AC-PC], and 10.2 mm lateral to the midline). Despite reported concerns about distortion on the MR image, reconstructions provided consistent data for the localization of electrodes. The neurosurgical procedures used, which were guided by combined neuroimaging and neurophysiological methods, resulted in the consistent placement of DBS electrodes in the subthalamus and mesencephalon such that the electrode contacts passed through the STN and dorsally adjacent fields of Forel (FF) and zona incerta (ZI). The mean location of the clinically effective contacts was in the anterodorsal STN (mean 1.62 mm posterior to the MCP, 2.47 mm inferior to the AC-PC, and 11.72 mm lateral to the midline). Clinically effective stimulation was most commonly directed at the anterodorsal STN, with the current spreading into the dorsally adjacent FF and ZI.CONCLUSIONS: The anatomical localization of clinically effective electrode contacts provided in this study yields useful information for the postoperative programming of DBS electrodes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> According to manufacturers of both magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines, and implantable neurological pulse generators (IPGs), MRI is contraindicated for patients with IPGs. A major argument for this restriction is the risk to induce heat in the leads due to the electromagnetic field, which could be dangerous for the surrounding brain parenchyma. The temperature change on the surface of the case of an ITREL-III (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN) and the lead tip during MRI was determined. An anatomical realistic and a cubic phantom, filled with phantom material mimicking human tissue, and a typical lead configuration were used to imitate a patient who carries an IPG for deep brain stimulation. The measurements were performed in a 1.5 T and a 3.0 T MRI. 2.1 degrees C temperature increases at the lead tip uncovered the lead tip as the most critical part concerning heating problems in IPGs. Temperature increases in other locations were low compared to the one at the lead tip. The measured temperature increase of 2.1 degrees C can not be considered as harmful to the patient. Comparison with the results of other studies revealed the avoidance of loops as a practical method to reduce heating during MRI procedures. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Noninvasive magnetic stimulation of the human central nervous system has been used in research and the clinic for several years. However, the coils used previously stimulated mainly the cortical brain regions but could not stimulate deeper brain regions directly. The purpose of the current study was to develop a coil to stimulate deep brain regions. Stimulation of the nucleus accumbens and the nerve fibers connecting the prefrontal cortex with the nucleus accumbens was one major target of the authors' coil design. Numeric simulations of the electrical field induced by several types of coils were performed and accordingly an optimized coil for deep brain stimulation was designed. The electrical field induced by the new coil design was measured in a phantom brain and compared with the double-cone coil. The numeric simulations show that the electrical fields induced by various types of coils are always greater in cortical regions (closer to the coil placement); however, the decrease in electrical field within the brain (as a function of the distance from the coil) is markedly slower for the new coil design. The phantom brain measurements basically confirmed the numeric simulations. The suggested coil is likely to have the ability of deep brain stimulation without the need to increase the intensity to levels that stimulate cortical regions to a much higher extent and possibly cause undesirable side effects. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Contrary to the traditional view that receptive fields are limited in spatial extent, recent studies have indicated that the response of neurons to a local stimulus within the receptive field can be modulated by stimulation of the surrounding region. Here we quantified the nature of these contextual effects on visual motion responses of neurons in the pigeon's optic tectum using standard extracellular recording techniques. All of the cells tested responded well to a test spot moving across their receptive fields. When a background pattern was moved in the same or in a similar direction as that of the test spot, the responses of most deep tectal neurons to the test spot were maximally inhibited. Movement of the background in the opposite or near opposite direction produced minimal inhibition or even facilitation. For some deep tectal neurons, this directionally selective modulation by the moving background was maintained when the background motion was paired with different movement directions of the test spot (including both the preferred and least preferred directions). Thus, this selectivity for opposing motion was independent of the absolute direction of either the test spot or the background, a finding which is consistent with the results reported by Frost and Nakayama (1983), although they did not include all test spot directions. For some other neurons, identified here for the first time, the background movement selectively modulated the response only when the test spot moved in the neuron's preferred directions. These neurons lost selectivity for opposing motion when the test spot moved in nonpreferred directions. The significance of these contextual effects on the motion response of tectal neurons may be related to how the brain distinguishes self-induced motion from object motion and segregates figure from ground. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neuropsychologists are increasingly involved in surgical candidacy evaluations and postoperative neurobehavioral assessments of patients with movement disorders, most notably those with Parkinson's disease (PD). We review here the initial studies regarding neuropsychological outcomes of deep brain stimulation (DBS) within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) for treatment of PD. Overall, these initial investigations provide preliminary support for the cognitive and neurobehavioral safety of STN DBS. Improvements in self-reported symptoms of depression and diminished verbal fluency were the most common findings, whereas changes in global cognitive abilities, memory, attention, and frontal/executive functions were inconsistent and most often described as nominal and/or transient. The generalizability of this literature is hindered by several methodological limitations, including small samples and the absence of appropriate control participants. The clinical and theoretical implications of these initial studies are highlighted and recommendations are offered to guide future research. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We explored the effects of microstimulation on target selection by delivering stimulation at different depths within V1 (striate cortex) of the rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta). Stimulation evoked saccadic eye movements that terminated in the receptive-field location of the activated neurons. The current thresholds for saccade evocation were highest (&amp;gt; or = 30 micro A) in the superficial layers and lowest (&amp;lt; or = 10 micro A) in the deep layers. To study target selection, one visual target was presented in the receptive-field location of the stimulated neurons and a second visual target was presented outside this location. Microstimulation delivered in concert with the appearance of the two targets decreased the probability that a monkey would select the target placed in the receptive-field location when the upper layers of V1 were stimulated, and it increased this probability when the lower layers were stimulated. We suggest that microstimulation of the upper layers of V1 disrupts visual signals from retina en route to higher cortical areas, whereas microstimulation of the lower layers activates V1 efferents that innervate the oculomotor system. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Stimulation of the greater occipital nerve induces increased central excitability of dural afferent input. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Patients with primary headaches often report pain that involves not only the front of the head, innervated by the first (ophthalmic) division of the trigeminal nerve, but also the back of the head, innervated by the greater occipital nerve (GON) that is a branch of the C(2) spinal root. The aim of this work was to study the physiology of trigeminocervical input in a model of cranial nociception by describing a population of nociceptive neurones that receive convergent input from the supratentorial dura and the GON. Rats were anaesthetized with pentobarbital, paralysed and ventilated. The parietal dura above the middle meningeal artery was stimulated through a closed cranial window. The GON was exposed in the neck and stimulated. Recordings were made from 67 neurones (52 wide dynamic range neurones/15 nociceptive-specific-neurones) in the C(2) spinal dorsal horn, which responded to stimulation of the dura and the GON. Most neurones showed receptive fields corresponding to the first trigeminal division as well as input from C(2) skin and muscle. Neurones were recorded in superficial and deep layers of the dorsal horn. All neurones tested received input from the ipsilateral and contralateral GON (n = 5). The responses to dural stimulation were analysed before and after stimulation of the GON. Supramaximal electrical stimulation of the GON (20 s to 5 min) enhanced afferent dural input in 8/20 neurones. Application of the C-fibre activator mustard oil (MO) to the cutaneous receptive field or suboccipital muscles innervated by the GON induced an increased excitability of dural responses in 8/12 and 9/10 neurones, respectively. Stimulation of muscle afferents had a significant longer facilitatory effect than cutaneous stimulation (P &amp;lt; 0.05). These results show that a considerable population of neurones show convergent input from both dura as well as cervical cutaneous and muscle territories, which supports the view of a functional continuum between the caudal trigeminal nucleus and upper cervical segments involved in cranial nociception. The facilitatory effect of GON stimulation on dural stimulation suggests a central mechanism at the second order neurone level. This mechanism may be important in pain referral from cervical structures to the head and therefore have implications for most forms of primary headache. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (VIM) provides remarkable relief of tremor in the limbs contralateral to the side of the brain stimulated. The benefits have been sufficiently dramatic that this is now an accepted clinical treatment of essential as well as other forms of tremor. Despite this clinical benefit, the mechanism of action of DBS remains unknown. In this investigation, we sought to determine the effects of VIM DBS on neuronal function.METHODS: The authors used PET measurements of qualitative regional cerebral blood flow in patients with essential tremor to determine the effects of DBS in the left VIM. Each subject had four to six scans with the arms at rest and DBS turned either on or off during alternate scans. Continuous physiologic monitoring revealed no tremor during any of the scans. The PET images from each subject were aligned, averaged, and coregistered to a standard image oriented in stereotactic space.RESULTS: The authors used subtraction image analysis with statistical parametric mapping methods and a restricted volume search to identify a significantly increased flow response at the site of stimulation in thalamus. An exploratory analysis revealed increased flow in ipsilateral supplementary motor area, a region that receives afferents from VIM.CONCLUSIONS: The increased blood flow at terminal fields of thalamocortical projections suggests that DBS stimulates and does not inactivate projection neurons in VIM thalamus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Anatomical studies indicate that a relatively large percentage of spinohypothalamic tract (SHT) neurons are located within thoracic spinal segments. The aim of this study was to characterize the responses of SHT neurons in these segments of rats to innocuous and noxious stimulation of the skin and of a visceral structure, the bile duct. In addition, we attempted to determine the trajectories of the axons of the examined neurons within the diencephalon and brainstem. Fifty-three SHT neurons were recorded within segments T8-T13 in urethane anesthetized rats. Each cell was antidromically activated using current pulses &amp;lt; or = 30 microA delivered from the tip of an electrode located within the contralateral hypothalamus. The recording points were located in the superficial dorsal horn (9) and deep dorsal horn (44). All examined SHT neurons had receptive fields on the posterior thorax and anterior and ventral abdomen of the ipsilateral side. Ninety percent of the 41 SHT neurons responded exclusively (13) or preferentially (24) to noxious cutaneous stimuli. Thirteen of 27 (48%) examined units were activated by forceful distention of the bile duct. Response thresholds ranged from 30 to 40 mmHg. Responses incremented as pressures were increased to 50-80 mmHg. The axons of 22 of 28 (79%) examined SHT neurons appeared to cross the midline within the hypothalamus and terminate in the ipsilateral hypothalamus, thalamus or midbrain. The results indicate that SHT neurons in thoracic spinal cord of rats are capable of conveying somatic and visceral nociceptive information from the bile duct directly to targets at various levels of the brain bilaterally. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The use of electrical fields to treat epilepsy is undergoing increased scrutiny as an alternative to medications and resective surgery. Much recent attention has been focused on ionic channels and seizure control; however, nonsynaptic mechanisms may be crucial for seizure onset, raising the possibility of using electrical field application to abort seizures. Furthermore, the inhibitory effects may outlast the immediate treatment and possibly be a prophylactic intervention. This paper reviews the use of brain stimulation for treatment of epilepsy, but also cites instances where the antithetical results occur. The greatest detail focuses on disrupting the onset or shortening the seizure. The paper does not extensively review deep brain or vagal nerve stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVES: In 3 of 5 patients with dystonia and bilaterally implanted deep brain stimulating electrodes, focal transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of one motor cortex elicited bilateral hand motor responses. The aim of this study was to clarify the origin of these ipsilateral responses.METHODS: TMS and electrical stimulation of corticospinal fibres by the implanted electrodes were performed and the evoked hand motor potentials were analysed.RESULTS: In comparison with responses elicited by contralateral motor cortex stimulation, ipsilateral responses were smaller in amplitude (3.0+/-1.4 versus 5.8+/-1.5 mV), had shorter peak latencies (first negative peak: 20.9+/-0.8 versus 25.1+/-0.4 ms) and were followed by a shorter-lasting silent period (46+/-4 versus 195+/-35 ms). Ipsilateral responses following TMS had similar peak latencies to responses elicited subcortically by deep brain stimulation (DBS) (20.4+/-0.9 ms).CONCLUSIONS: Hand motor responses ipsilateral to TMS result from a subcortical activation of corticospinal fibres, via the implanted electrode in the other hemisphere, secondary to currents induced by TMS in subcutaneous wire loops that underlie the magnetic coil. Studies of TMS in patients with DBS have to take this potential source of confounding into account. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neuropsychological deficits in essential tremor: an expression of cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathophysiology? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Few studies have been published regarding the neuropsychological characteristics of patients with essential tremor (ET), but preliminary findings suggest that mild attentional and executive dysfunction accompany the disorder. A consecutive series of 101 patients with ET referred for thalamotomy and/or thalamic deep brain stimulation candidacy work-up also underwent neuropsychological evaluation. Average neuropsychological test scores were calculated, along with the proportions of subjects whose scores fell within or more than one SD above or below the mean (using demographically corrected normative data). Significantly lower than average (T-score of 50) scores were evident on measures of complex auditory attention, visual attention and response inhibition, recall of a word list, verbal fluency, and visual confrontation naming. A significantly greater proportion of patients (ranging from about 34 to 60%) than might be expected on the basis of a normal distribution obtained scores more than one SD below the normative mean on select measures of attention, verbal fluency, immediate word list recall, semantic encoding, and facial matching. Consistent with prior research, notable, albeit clinically subtle, deficits in attention and select executive functions are evident in patients with ET. Although not specific to ET or cerebellar dysfunction, the observed pattern of cognitive deficits is consistent with cerebello-thalamo-cortical circuit dysfunction. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Representation of sound source direction in the superior colliculus of the guinea pig in a virtual auditory environment. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) receive visual, auditory, and somatosensory input. A major function of the SC is the control of orientation movements of the eye, head, and pinna. While a topographical map for sound source direction remains elusive in primary auditory structures of mammals, such a map for azimuthal sound source directions has been reported in the deep layers of the SC. Moreover, a gradient of elevation tuning has been also seen in the SC of ferrets and cats. Here we demonstrate that a virtual auditory environment can be used to reveal azimuthal and elevational topography for auditory spatial receptive fields in neurons in the SC of guinea pigs. Individual, head-related transfer functions (HRTF) were measured in ten guinea pigs for 122 directions in the upper hemispheric field and convolved with white noise. Many neurons (39%) in the deep layers showed robust responses to these virtual sounds, and the majority of these neurons had small spatial receptive fields that were restricted to the contralateral hemifield. Best directions varied from 0 degree to 135 degree azimuth along the contralateral side and from --10 degree to 60 degree elevation. Like previous studies using free-field stimulation, a gradient of best azimuth direction was found along the rostral-caudal axis, with rear directions represented caudally and front directions rostrally. The topographical organization for best elevations had not been studied previously in the guinea pig. We found that it roughly followed the mediolateral axis, with preference for high elevations represented medially and low elevations laterally. A similar organization using free-field stimulation has been reported in the ferret. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neurophysiological refinement of subthalamic nucleus targeting. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: Advances in image-guided stereotactic surgery, microelectrode recording techniques, and stimulation technology have been the driving forces behind a resurgence in the use of functional neurosurgery for the treatment of movement disorders. Despite the dramatic effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) techniques in ameliorating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, many critical questions related to the targeting, effects, and mechanisms of action of DBS remain unanswered. In this report, we describe the methods used to localize the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and we present the characteristics of encountered cells.METHODS: Twenty-six patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease underwent simultaneous, bilateral, microelectrode-refined, DBS electrode implantation into the STN. Direct and indirect magnetic resonance imaging-based anatomic targeting was used. Cellular activity was analyzed for various neurophysiological parameters, including firing rates and interspike intervals. Physiological targeting confirmation was obtained by performing macrostimulation through the final DBS electrode.RESULTS: The average microelectrode recording time for each trajectory was 20 minutes, with a mean of 5.2 trajectories/patient. Typical trajectories passed through the anterior thalamus, zona incerta/fields of Forel, STN, and substantia nigra-pars reticulata. Each structure exhibited a characteristic firing pattern. In particular, recordings from the STN exhibited an increase in background activity and an irregular firing pattern, with a mean rate of 47 Hz. The mean cell density was 5.6 cells/mm, with an average maximal trajectory length of 5.3 mm. Macrostimulation via the DBS electrode yielded mean sensory and motor thresholds of 4.2 and 5.7 V, respectively.CONCLUSION: The principal objectives of microelectrode recording refinement of anatomic targeting are precise identification of the borders of the STN and thus determination of its maximal length. Microelectrode recording also allows identification of the longest and most lateral segment of the STN, which is our preferred target for STN DBS electrode implantation. Macrostimulation via the final DBS electrode is then used primarily to establish the side effect profile for postoperative stimulation. Microelectrode recording is a helpful targeting adjunct that will continue to facilitate our understanding of basal ganglion physiological features. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> BACKGROUND: The long-term neuropsychological and quality of life (QOL) outcomes of unilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with intractable Parkinson's disease (PD) have not heretofore been described.METHOD: Six patients diagnosed with PD underwent unilateral DBS implantation into a verified thalamic VIM nucleus target. Participants completed presurgical neuropsychological evaluation and follow-up assessment at approximately one year postsurgery.FINDINGS: Compared to their presurgical scores, PD patients exhibited significant improvement on measures of conceptualization, verbal memory, emotional adjustment, and QOL at one-year follow-up. A few nominal declines were observed across the battery of tests.INTERPRETATION: These data provide preliminary support for the long-term neurocognitive safety and QOL improvements following thalamic stimulation in patients with PD. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal globus pallidus (GPi) deep brain stimulation (DBS) on intracortical inhibition (ICI) in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease (PD).METHODS: The activity of intracortical inhibitory circuits was studied in 4 PD patients implanted with stimulating electrodes both in STN and GPi by means of paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation, delivered in a conditioning-test design at short (1-6 ms) interstimulus intervals (ISI). The effect of apomorphine on the same PD patients was also investigated.RESULTS: We observed that implanted PD patients showed a significant increase in ICI during either bilateral STN or GPi DBS at 3 ms ISI, and during bilateral STN DBS at 2 ms ISI in comparison to their off DBS condition. The same statistical improvement was observed during apomorphine infusion at 3 and 2 ms ISI. In each condition, the electrophysiological changes were associated with a significant clinical improvement as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor examination.CONCLUSIONS: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that basal ganglia DBS can mimic the effects of pharmacological dopaminergic therapy on PD patients cortical activity. We propose that in PD patients, the basal ganglia DBS-induced improvement of ICI may be related to a recovery in modulation of thalamo-cortical motor pathway. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Nonvisual influences on visual-information processing in the superior colliculus. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although visually responsive neurons predominate in the deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC), the majority of them also receive sensory inputs from nonvisual sources (i.e. auditory and/or somatosensory). Most of these 'multisensory' neurons are able to synthesize their cross-modal inputs and, as a consequence, their responses to visual stimuli can be profoundly enhanced or depressed in the presence of a nonvisual cue. Whether response enhancement or response depression is produced by this multisensory interaction is predictable based on several factors. These include: the organization of a neuron's visual and nonvisual receptive fields; the relative spatial relationships of the different stimuli (to their respective receptive fields and to one another); and whether or not the neuron is innervated by a select population of cortical neurons. The response enhancement or depression of SC neurons via multisensory integration has significant survival value via its profound impact on overt attentive/orientation behaviors. Nevertheless, these multisensory processes are not present at birth, and require an extensive period of postnatal maturation. It seems likely that the sensory experiences obtained during this period play an important role in crafting the processes underlying these multisensory interactions. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sensory and multisensory responses in the newborn monkey superior colliculus. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Superior colliculus (SC) neurons have the ability to synthesize information from different sensory modalities, resulting in enhancements (or depressions) of their activity. This physiological capacity is, in turn, closely tied to changes in overt attentive and orientation responses. The present study shows that, in contrast to more altricial species, many deep layer SC neurons in the rhesus monkey are multisensory at birth. Such neurons can respond to stimuli from different sensory modalities, and all convergence patterns seen in the adult are represented. Nevertheless, these neurons cannot yet synthesize their multisensory inputs. Rather, they respond to combinations of cross-modal stimuli much like they respond to their individual modality-specific components. This immature property of multisensory neurons is in contrast to many of the surprisingly sophisticated modality-specific response properties of these neurons and of their modality-specific neighbors. Thus, although deep SC neurons in the newborn have longer latencies and larger receptive fields than their adult counterparts, they are already highly active and are distributed in the typical adult admixture of visual, auditory, somatosensory, and multisensory neurons. Furthermore, the receptive fields of these neurons are already ordered into well organized topographic maps, and the different receptive fields of the same multisensory neurons show a good degree of cross-modal spatial register. These data, coupled with those from cat, suggest that the capacity to synthesize multisensory information does not simply appear in SC neurons at a prescribed maturational stage but rather develops only after substantial experience with cross-modal cues. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The functional organization of area 3a, a cortical field proposed to be involved in somato-motor-vestibular integration, has never been described for any primate. In the present investigation, the topographic organization and connections of area 3a were examined in marmosets using electrophysiological recording and anatomical tracing techniques. Multi-unit neuronal activity was recorded at a number of closely spaced sites; receptive fields (RFs) for neurons were determined, and the optimal stimulus was identified. In all cases, neurons in area 3a responded to the stimulation of deep receptors on the contralateral body. The representation of the body in area 3a was from the toes and foot, to the hindlimb, trunk, forelimb, hand and face in a mediolateral progression. In all cases electrophysiological results were related to myeloarchitecture, and the map in area 3a was found to be coextensive with a strip of lightly to moderately myelinated cortex just rostral to the darkly myelinated 3b. To examine the cortical connections of area 3a, injections of anatomical tracers were made into electrophysiologically identified body part representations. Area 3a has dense intrinsic connections and receives substantial inputs from the primary motor cortex (M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), areas 1 and 2, the second somatosensory area (S2), and areas in posterior parietal cortex (PP). The connections of area 3a indicate that integration of cortical representations of body parts occurs both within area 3a and between area 3a and other somatosensory and motor areas. In addition, there are differential patterns of interconnections between behaviorally relevant body part representations of area 3a, such as the forelimb, compared to other body part representations (hindlimb/ trunk), especially with 'higher order' cortical fields. This suggests that 3a may be an important component in a network that generates a common frame of reference for hand and eye coordinated reaching tasks. </td>

Anatomical and functional intraoperative mapping are mandatory to obtain careful target localisation. Per-operative macrostimulation was carried out in 22 patients undergoing bilateral DBS in Stn; a volume 6 mm above to 4 mm below Stn was explored. Positive, collateral and adverse effects were recorded every 2 mm. Results obtained during acute stimulation were correlated to anatomical data from stereotactic atlases. Our findings suggest a volume, encompassing the zona incerta, Forel's fields and the lowermost part of anterior thalamus, functionally homogeneous to Stn. In fact, the stimulation of this volume obtains reduction of PD symptoms comparable to Stn. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study was to address whether improvement in anxious symptoms after surgical treatment of Parkinson disease (PD) reflects a true reduction in anxiety as opposed to an epiphenomenon of parkinsonian symptom amelioration.BACKGROUND: Recent research suggests that anxiety is common in PD. An association between surgical intervention for PD and anxiety reduction has been reported; however, it is not clear which specific symptoms of anxiety improve.METHOD: Thirty-nine PD patients completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) approximately 1 month before and 4 months after surgery. Twenty-four participants underwent unilateral pallidotomy, 10 underwent deep brain stimulating electrode implantation of the internal segment of the globus pallidus, 4 underwent thalamic deep brain stimulating electrode implantation, and 1 underwent left thalamotomy.RESULTS: Statistically significant reductions were found postoperatively in terms of BAI total score as well as neurophysiologic, autonomic, and subjective factors from the BAI. The panic factor did not significantly change after surgery, possibly secondary to limited power afforded by the sample size.CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that surgical intervention for PD is associated with reduction in anxiety symptoms distinct from symptoms of PD. In other words, improvement in anxious symptoms reflects a true reduction in anxiety rather than simply being an epiphenomenon of parkinsonian symptom amelioration. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We studied 13 healthy subjects with a multichannel magnetoencephalography (MEG) system to investigate the somatotopic representation of the ear in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI). We stimulated three parts of the left ear: the helix, the lobulus, and the tragus. The somatosensory-evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) were successfully measured in 7 of 13 subjects. Short-latency responses were analyzed using both single dipole and multidipole models (brain electric source analysis, BESA). From the single dipole model, the equivalent current dipole (ECD) following the helix stimulation was estimated to be near the neck area of SI in all the subjects. In the lobulus stimulation, the ECDs were estimated around the neck area of SI in four subjects, in the face area in one subject, and in the deep white matter in two subjects. In the tragus stimulation, the ECDs were estimated around the neck area of SI in three subjects, in the hand area of SI in two subjects, and in the deep white matter in two subjects. When the ECDs were estimated to be located in unlikely sites (hand area and deep white matter), a two-dipole model, (1) the neck area of SI and (2) face area of SI, was found to be the most appropriate. Although this might be a preliminary study due to a relatively small number of subjects, it revealed that receptive fields of some part of the ear, such as the lobulus and tragus, might be present in both the neck and face areas of SI. These findings suggested that the &amp;quot;ear area&amp;quot; of SI has variability between subjects, unlike the other areas of SI, possibly because the ear is located on the border between the neck and face. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Single-neuron activities were recorded in the hindlimb region of the primary somatosensory cortex and part of area 5 in awake Japanese monkeys. A total of 1050 units were isolated from five hemispheres of four animals. Receptive fields (RFs) and submodalities were identified for 90% of isolated neurons in areas 3a and 3b. The percentage decreased as the recoding site moved to the more caudal areas. Deep or skin submodality neurons were dominant in area 3a or area 3b, respectively. Deep submodality neurons increased in more caudal areas and were the majority in areas 2 and 5. These observations were consistent with those in the hand and/or digit or arm and/or trunk region. The identified neurons were classified by their RF positions into four types: the foot, leg, foot and leg, or hindlimb and other body parts type. Among 831 identified neurons, 33 neurons had bilateral RFs, 14 had ipsilateral RFs, and the rest (N=784) had contralateral RFs. The relative incidence of neurons with bilateral or ipsilateral RFs among identified neurons was less than 1% in areas 3a, 3b, and 1, and 16% or 25% in areas 2 or 5, respectively. Within areas 2 and 5, the percentage of neurons with bilateral or ipsilateral RFs was significantly smaller in the foot type (5%) than in other RF types (24-57%). RFs of the foot type were on the sole or single toe but never on multiple toes. These observations contrasted with the previous findings that neurons with bilateral RFs were more frequently seen in the hand and/or digit region and that RFs on multiple digit tips were dominant there. The present study thus demonstrated that neurons with bilateral RFs do exist in the hindlimb region. Similarly to the forelimb region, they were found mostly in areas 2 and 5, the caudalmost areas of the postcentral gyrus and hierarchically higher stages in information processing. The relative paucity of neurons with bilateral RFs on the foot, especially those with RFs on multiple toes, may reflect functional differences between the foot and the hand. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The essential issue of electroshock therapy (ECT) is the activity of physical stimulus, i.e., the electric current, on the disturbed structures of the brain. ECT sessions--when chronically applied for evoking antidepressive effects--are responsible for the appearance of excessive incitement in the neuronal net in the brain tissue in a form of self-sustaining after-discharge (SSAD) (convulsive attack characteristic for ECT). The study presents the computer research on basic biophysical phenomena of electroshock therapy (flow of electric current in the structures of the head just before convulsive attack). Five-layer 3-D model of the head was created in OPERA-3D (Vector Fields Ltd., Oxford), general 3 dimensional issues solver. Geometrical dimensions and electrophysical properties of each layer correspond with natural properties. The model was subjected to the action of electric stimulation (parameters identical to those applied in clinical conditions). Analysis of the flow in particular layers revealed the crawling/spreading effect present not only in the scalp layer but also in the layer of cerebrospinal fluid. The effect is conditioned by &amp;quot;deeper situated&amp;quot; lesser conduction of electricity-respectively skull bones, brain tissue. Crawling effect is the reason why only 5-15% of the electricity applied on the surface of the head reaches the surface of the brain. Electro-stimulation examinations also showed that the values of the so called density of the current in layers of brain tissue balanced between 1-10 mA/mm2. The current parameters of ECT were effective in evoking subsequent convulsive attack and safe for the brain tissue. The model was subjected to the action of magnetic stimulation according to the parameters of neurologic technique of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). ELECTRA module was used to solve wire-current issues. The examination showed more regular distribution of current vectors in all layers of the head. The density of cerebral cortex was 0.1-1 mA/mm2, confirming markedly lesser current charge than that observed during ECT. The problem of magnetic stimulation efficacy in irritating deep structures of the brain demands further studies. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> This study explored the multidimensional outcome of three neurosurgical interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD): pallidotomy (N = 23), pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) (N = 9), and thalamic DBS (N = 7). All patients completed the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) and the Beck Depression Inventory. Pallidotomy patients also completed the Profile of Mood States, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and a disease-specific quality of life (QOL) measure, the Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39). Three months after surgery, all neurosurgical groups showed significant improvements in mood and function, including physical, psychosocial, and overall functioning. Pallidal DBS and pallidotomy patients who completed additional QOL measures reported decreased anxiety and tension, increased vigor, improved mobility and ability to perform activities of daily living, and decreased perceived stigma. Psychosocial dysfunction scores from the SIP were related to depressed mood both at baseline (r = .42) and at followup (r = .45), but the physical dysfunction subscale was not related to mood at either time point, suggesting that disruption of social relationships due to PD may have more impact on affective distress than physical symptoms alone. Results suggest that neurosurgical interventions for PD improve disabling PD motor symptoms and also improve several domains of quality of life. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cognitive outcomes after deep brain stimulation for Parkinson's disease: a review of initial studies and recommendations for future research. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Modern ablative surgery for movement disorders probably results in less frequent and severe cognitive morbidity than seen in early surgical series. Nonetheless, recent studies indicate that neurobehavioral functions commonly compromised in Parkinson's disease (PD) (e.g., executive functions, verbal fluency, and memory) are negatively impacted in some patients by lesion placement. The potential reversibility of cognitive dysfunction after chronic electrical deep brain stimulation (DBS) for PD has lead some to favor this treatment modality over ablation. This paper reviews the initial studies of the cognitive effects of thalamic, pallidal, and subthalamic DBS. These studies suggest that DBS is relatively safe from a cognitive standpoint and that the benefits of motor improvements probably outweigh the cost of minimal cognitive morbidity. This conclusion must be offered with caution, however, given the small numbers of studies to date and their methodological limitations. Neurobehavioral research has yet to adequately address (1) outcome relative to appropriate control groups; (2) effects of electrode placement versus stimulation; (3) laterality- and site-specific effects of DBS; (4) long-term effects of DBS; (5) effects of stimulation parameters; (6) risk factors for cognitive dysfunction with DBS; (7) whether cognitive dysfunction associated with DBS is reversible; and (8) comparative neurobehavioral outcome after DBS and ablation. DBS affords an exciting opportunity to clarify the neurobehavioral role of the basal ganglia. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Multiple somatosensory areas in the anterior parietal cortex of the California ground squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyii). </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Multiunit electrophysiological recording techniques were used to explore the somatosensory cortex of the California ground squirrel (Spermophilus beecheyii). Cortex rostral and caudal to the primary somatosensory area (SI) contained neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and to muscle and joint manipulation. The region of cortex rostral to SI was termed the rostral field (R) because of possible homologies with a similar field described in other mammals. Cortex caudal to SI had neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and has been termed the parietal medial area (PM), as in previous investigations in squirrels. Like SI, both R and PM contained a complete or almost complete representation of the body surface, although the receptive field size for clusters of neurons in these regions was somewhat larger than those for clusters of neurons in SI. Electrophysiological recording results were correlated with histologically processed tissue that had been sectioned tangentially. Although SI was clearly identified as a myelin-dense region, both R and PM stained much less densely for myelin. Our results indicate that as in a number of other mammals including monotremes, marsupials, carnivores, and primates, the anterior parietal cortex of the California ground squirrel contains multiple representations of the sensory epithelium. This work, as well as a growing body of studies of somatosensory cortex organization in a variety of mammals, indicates that anterior parietal fields other than SI existed early in mammalian evolution, and were present in the common ancestor of all mammals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In seven female alpha-chloralose-anesthetized cats, 52 lateral thalamic neurons were tested with noxious distension of the urinary bladder, the distal colon and the lower esophagus. In addition, the neurons were characterized with innocuous and noxious mechanical stimulation of the skin and deep structures. Of the 52 neurons tested, 32 (62%) were visceroceptive. Of these visceroceptive neurons, 20 (63%) were located in the periphery of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLp), 10 (31%) in the adjacent posterior complex (PO), and two (6%) in the ventrolateral nucleus (VL). No differences were found with respect to location between neurons responsive or unresponsive to visceral stimulation. Ten neurons (31%) received input from more than one viscus and, therefore, showed viscerovisceral convergence. Excitatory or &amp;quot;inhibitory&amp;quot; responses were elicited by stimulation of the esophagus in 21 neurons, of the colon in 13, and of the urinary bladder in 11 neurons. No indications were found for a segregation of neurons responsive to a certain viscus and their location in VPLp or PO. Of 51 neurons, for which a somatic receptive field was determined, 44 (86%) exhibited low threshold type (LT), and seven (14%) wide dynamic range type (WDR) responses. The data indicate that there might exist a somatovisceral coregistration, because many neurons (69%) had homosegmental receptive fields, and bladder stimulation was the most successful stimulus. It is concluded that VPLp and the adjacent PO in the cat play a role in the perception and localization of painful events originating from thoracic and pelvic organs. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Microelectrode mapping techniques were used to determine the organization of somatosensory cortex in the Australian brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). The results of electrophysiological mapping were combined with data on the cyto- and myeloarchitecture, and patterns of corticocortical connections, using sections cut tangential to the pial surface. We found evidence for three topographically organized representations of the body surface that were coextensive with architectonic subdivisions. A large, discontinuous cutaneous representation in anterior parietal cortex was termed the primary somatosensory area (SI). Lateral to SI we found evidence for two further areas, the second somatosensory area (SII) and the parietal ventral area (PV). While neurones in all of these areas were responsive to cutaneous stimulation, those of SI were non-habituating, whereas those in SII and PV often habituated to the stimuli. Moreover, neuronal receptive fields in SII and PV were, in general, larger than those in SI. Neurones in cortex adjacent to the rostral and caudal boundaries of SI, including cortex that interdigitated between the discontinuous SI head and body representations, required stimulation of deep receptors in the periphery to elicit responses. Within the region of cortex containing neurones responsive to stimulation of deep receptors, body parts were represented in a mediolateral progression. Injections of anatomical tracers placed in electrophysiologically identified locations in SI revealed ipsilateral connections with other parts of SI, as well as cortex rostral to, caudal to, and interdigitating between, SI. Injections in SI also resulted in labelling in PV, SII, motor cortex, posterior parietal cortex and perirhinal cortex. The patterns of contralateral projections reflected those of ipsilateral projections, although they were relatively less dense. The present findings support recent observations in other marsupials in which multiple representations of the body surface were described, and suggest that multiple interconnected sensory representations may be a common feature of cortical organization and function in marsupials. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> OBJECTIVE: To evaluate short-term effects of unilateral thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) on cognition, mood state, and quality of life in patients with essential tremor (ET).BACKGROUND: Unilateral thalamotomy and thalamic DBS are effective in alleviating refractory tremor contralateral to the side of surgery. Thalamotomy can lead to cognitive morbidity, and DBS might be a preferable surgical intervention given potential avoidance or reversibility of such morbidity. Although unilateral thalamic DBS is cognitively safe and leads to quality of life improvement in PD, its neurobehavioral effects in ET are unknown.METHODS: Forty patients with ET were administered a broad neuropsychological test battery, measures of mood state, and generic and disease-specific quality of life measures approximately 1 month before and 3 months after surgery (left hemisphere, 38 patients).RESULTS: Unilateral thalamic DBS was associated with significant improvements in tremor and dominant-hand fine visuomotor coordination. Statistically significant but clinically modest gains were observed on tasks of visuoperceptual and constructional ability, visual attention, delayed word list recognition, and prose recall. Only lexical verbal fluency declined significantly after surgery. Patients rated themselves as less anxious after surgery, and they perceived their quality of life as improved significantly. In particular, patients reported improved quality of life with respect to activities of daily living, stigma, emotional well-being, and communication.CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral thalamic DBS for ET is cognitively safe and associated with improvements in anxiety and quality of life in the near term and in the absence of operative complications. Patients were better able to carry out activities of daily living after surgery, and they reported improvement in several psychosocial domains of quality of life. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Thalamic single neuron activity in patients with dystonia: dystonia-related activity and somatic sensory reorganization. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Indirect evidence suggests that the thalamus contributes to abnormal movements occurring in patients with dystonia (dystonia patients). The present study tested the hypothesis that thalamic activity contributes to the dystonic movements that occur in such patients. During these movements, spectral analysis of electromyographic (EMG) signals in flexor and extensor muscles of the wrist and elbow exhibited peak EMG power in the lowest frequency band [0-0.78 Hz (mean: 0.39 Hz) dystonia frequency] for 60-85% of epochs studied during a pointing task. Normal controls showed low-frequency peaks for &amp;lt;16% of epochs during pointing. Among dystonia patients, simultaneous contraction of antagonistic muscles (cocontraction) at dystonia frequency during pointing was observed for muscles acting about the wrist (63% of epochs) and elbow (39%), but cocontraction was not observed among normal controls during pointing. Thalamic neuronal signals were recorded during thalamotomy for treatment of dystonia and were compared with those of control patients without motor abnormality who were undergoing thalamic procedures for treatment of chronic pain. Presumed nuclear boundaries of a human thalamic cerebellar relay nucleus (ventral intermediate, Vim) and a pallidal relay nucleus (ventral oral posterior, Vop) were estimated by aligning the anterior border of the principal sensory nucleus (ventral caudal, Vc) with the region where the majority of cells have cutaneous receptive fields (RFs). The ratio of power at dystonia frequency to average spectral power was &amp;gt;2 (P &amp;lt; 0.001) for cells in presumed Vop often for dystonia patients (81%) but never for control patients. The percentage of such cells in presumed Vim of dystonia patients (32%) was not significantly different from that of controls (31%). Many cells in presumed Vop exhibited dystonia frequency activity that was correlated with and phase-advanced on EMG activity during dystonia, suggesting that this activity was related to dystonia. Thalamic somatic sensory activity also differed between dystonia patients and controls. The percentage of cells responding to passive joint movement or to manipulation of subcutaneous structures (deep sensory cells) in presumed Vim was significantly greater in patients with dystonia than in control patients undergoing surgery for treatment of pain or tremor. Dystonia patients had a significantly higher proportion of deep sensory cells responding to movement of more than one joint (26%, 13/52) than did &amp;quot;control&amp;quot; patients (8%, 4/49). Deep sensory cells in patients with dystonia were located in thalamic maps that demonstrated increased representations of parts of the body affected by dystonia. Thus dystonia patients showed increased receptive fields and an increased thalamic representation of dystonic body parts. The motor activity of an individual sensory cell was related to the sensory activity of that cell by identification of the muscle apparently involved in the cell's receptive field. Specifically, we defined the effector muscle as the muscle that, by contraction, produced the joint movement associated with a thalamic neuronal sensory discharge, when the examiner passively moved the joint. Spike X EMG correlation functions during dystonia indicated that thalamic cellular activity less often was related to EMG in effector muscles (52%) than in other muscles (86%). Thus there is a mismatch between the effector muscle for a thalamic cell and the muscles with EMG correlated with activity of that cell during dystonia. This mismatch may result from the reorganization of sensory maps and may contribute to the simultaneous activation of multiple muscles observed in dystonia. Microstimulation in presumed Vim in dystonia patients produced simultaneous contraction of multiple forearm muscles, similar to the simultaneous muscle contractions observed in dystonia.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cognitive outcome following staged bilateral pallidal stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> As neurosurgical treatment of parkinsonian symptoms has become increasingly popular, concern about the cognitive morbidity which may result from such interventions has risen proportionately. Previous reports of cognitive difficulties associated with pallidotomy and thalamotomy, especially in bilateral cases, have provided the impetus for research into chronic electrical deep brain stimulation procedures which are believed to be safer than ablation. Given the lack of neurobehavioral research following bilateral deep brain stimulation procedures, this preliminary study of six Parkinson's disease patients undergoing staged bilateral pallidal stimulation was undertaken. A battery of tests assessing attention, executive function, visuomotor coordination, language, visuoperceptual function, learning memory and mood revealed no significant change in overall level of cognitive functioning after either unilateral or bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation. No significant declines were observed about three months following bilateral stimulation, and in fact, significant gains in delayed recall and relief of anxiety symptoms were noted. It was concluded from this preliminary data that bilateral pallidal stimulation for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, at least in the absence of operative complications, offers a cognitively safe alternative to ablation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Retinotopic mapping of lateral geniculate nucleus in humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Subcortical nuclei in the thalamus, which play an important role in many functions of the human brain, provide challenging targets for functional mapping with neuroimaging techniques because of their small sizes and deep locations. In this study, we explore the capability of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 4 Tesla for mapping the retinotopic organization in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Our results show that the hemifield visual stimulation only activates LGN in the contralateral hemisphere, and the lower-field and upper-field visual stimulations activate the superior and inferior portion of LGN, respectively. These results reveal a similar retinotopic organization between the human and nonhuman primate LGN and between LGN and the primary visual cortex. We conclude that high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging is capable of functional mapping of suborganizations in small nuclei together with cortical activation. This will have an impact for studying the thalamocortical networks in the human brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neurotransmitter involvement in development and maintenance of the auditory space map in the guinea pig superior colliculus. J. Neurophysiol. 80: 2941-2953, 1998. The mammalian superior colliculus (SC) is a complex area of the midbrain in terms of anatomy, physiology, and neurochemistry. The SC bears representations of the major sensory modalites integrated with a motor output system. It is implicated with saccade generation, in behavioral responses to novel sensory stimuli and receives innervation from diverse regions of the brain using many neurotransmitter classes. Ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer (Elvax-40W polymer) was used here to deliver chronically neurotransmitter receptor antagonists to the SC of the guinea pig to investigate the potential role played by the major neurotransmitter systems in the collicular representation of auditory space. Slices of polymer containing different drugs were implanted onto the SC of guinea pigs before the development of the SC azimuthal auditory space map, at approximately 20 days after birth (DAB). A further group of animals was exposed to aminophosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) at approximately 250 DAB. Azimuthal spatial tuning properties of deep layer multiunits of anesthetized guinea pigs were examined approximately 20 days after implantation of the Elvax polymer. Broadband noise bursts were presented to the animals under anechoic, free-field conditions. Neuronal responses were used to construct polar plots representative of the auditory spatial multiunit receptive fields (MURFs). Animals exposed to control polymer could develop a map of auditory space in the SC comparable with that seen in unimplanted normal animals. Exposure of the SC of young animals to AP5, 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, or atropine, resulted in a reduction in the proportion of spatially tuned responses with an increase in the proportion of broadly tuned responses and a degradation in topographic order. Thus N-methyl--aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA glutamate receptors and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors appear to play vital roles in the development of the SC auditory space map. A group of animals exposed to AP5 beginning at approximately 250 DAB produced results very similar to those obtained in the young group exposed to AP5. Thus NMDA glutamate receptors also seem to be involved in the maintenance of the SC representation of auditory space in the adult guinea pig. Exposure of the SC of young guinea pigs to gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor blocking agents produced some but not total disruption of the spatial tuning of auditory MURFs. Receptive fields were large compared with controls, but a significant degree of topographical organization was maintained. GABA receptors may play a role in the development of fine tuning and sharpening of auditory spatial responses in the SC but not necessarily in the generation of topographical order of the these responses. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Chronic electrical stimulation of the left ventrointermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus for the treatment of pharmacotherapy-resistant Parkinson's disease: a differential impact on access to semantic and episodic memory? </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Thalamotomy for medically refractory Parkinson's disease (PD) is considered to be efficacious and relatively safe. Because a minority of patients experience decrements in language and memory (often mild and transient) after thalamotomy, chronic thalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) might be a safer treatment given its reversibility and the modifiability of stimulation parameters. Two preliminary studies support the relative cognitive safety of unilateral DBS of the ventral intermediate (Vim) thalamic nucleus, but it is unclear whether possibly subtle changes in language and memory represent effects of &amp;quot;microthalamotomy&amp;quot; or of stimulation per se. This report provides preliminary data concerning effects of left thalamic stimulation on information processing speed, semantic memory (verbal fluency and visual confrontation naming), and verbal episodic memory in a patient with PD. In addition to being evaluated before and 3 and 6 months after surgery, the patient was tested 18 months after surgery either on or off medications and with the stimulator turned either on or off (order counterbalanced across medication conditions). Test performance differences between the stimulation conditions were attenuated &amp;quot;off&amp;quot; as compared to &amp;quot;on&amp;quot; medication. Vim stimulation consistently, albeit subtly, improved semantic verbal fluency but interfered with immediate recall of word lists. Parallels to findings from acute, intraoperative thalamic stimulation studies are explored. The hypothesis is offered that left Vim stimulation might facilitate access to semantic memory, but interfere with episodic memory processes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The temporal and spatial processing of pain perception in human was traced by magnetoencephalography (MEG). We applied a painful CO2 laser beam to the forearm of 11 normal subjects, and estimated the activated areas using a single equivalent current dipole (ECD) at each time point, and a brain electric source analysis (BESA) as a spatio-temporal multiple source analysis method. The four-source model was found to be the most appropriate; sources 1 and 2 at the secondary sensory cortex (SII) contralateral and ipsilateral to the stimulation, and sources 3 and 4 at the anterior medial temporal area (probably the amygdalar nuclei or hippocampal formation) contralateral and ipsilateral to the stimulation, respectively. Activities in all 4 areas were temporally overlapped. Activity in the primary sensory cortex (SI) contralateral to the stimulated site was not identified. Activity in the cingulate cortex was also not clearly identified. These results are probably due to one or more of the following factors; (1) the cingulate cortex is too deep, (2) the ECDs generated in the cingulate cortex are mainly oriented radially, and (3) the ECDs generated in bilateral hemispheres interfere with each other. No significant or consistent magnetic fields were recorded after 500 msec following the stimulation, probably due to the complicated spatial and temporal overlapping of activities in multiple areas. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A patient is presented who suffered a lateral brainstem infarction which selectively abolished pain and temperature sensitivity in the lower right limb. One year later central post-stroke pain had developed in the affected limb with touch and cold allodynia. P40m dipoles calculated from magnetoencephalographic fields after electrical stimulation of both tibial nerves were localized in SI as is seen in normal subjects. However, stimulation of the affected side caused deep pain sensations and elicited a large N80m component, best explained by an additionally active dipole in cingulate cortex. This early co-activation in a limbic structure suggests peripheral Abeta-fiber mediation and lemniscal projection. Abnormal link to the pain system may be due to sensitization and reorganization above the level of nociceptive deafferentation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Motor evoked potentials (MEP) elicited by transcranial electrical and magnetoelectric stimulation were examined prospectively in a total of 122 patients with supratentorial tumorous and nontumorous lesions in an acute/subacute neurosurgical setting. All patients had a hemiparesis contralateral to the lesion. It was the aim of our study to define the diagnostic significance of MEP with respect to superficial and deep localization of the lesions. To achieve this goal, MEP findings were correlated with the clinical motor status defining two categories: correct with pathological MEP, and false-negative with normal MEP. On the whole, we found correct results in 108 of 122 patients (88.5%) with electrical stimulation, and in 67 of 75 patients (89.3%) with magnetoelectric stimulation. There were false-negative results in 4 (11.5%) and 8 (10.7%) cases, respectively. In particular, with electrical stimulation 14 of 65 (21.5%), and with magnetoelectric stimulation 8 of 43 (18.6%) superficial lesions were missed, whereas deep lesions were correctly assessed in every case by either stimulation technique. In conclusion, the diagnostic significance of MEP for assessment of superficial supratentorial lesions is limited with the methods applied in this study. Whether more refined techniques may provide different results in a similar setting remains to be proved. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Unilateral pallidotomy is thought to have a low risk for cognitive morbidity. Nonetheless, recent research suggests that some patients experience declines in memory and language and that pallidal stimulation might be a safer treatment for Parkinson's disease (PD). We investigated the neurobehavioral effects of unilateral pallidal stimulation. Nine consecutive PD patients undergoing unilateral deep brain-stimulating electrode implantation in the globus pallidus interna were evaluated with a neuropsychological test battery approximately 1 month before and 3 months after surgery. Patients reported significantly fewer symptoms of anxiety and greater vigor after surgery. There was a trend toward fewer depressive symptoms. Semantic verbal fluency and visuoconstructional test scores declined significantly after surgery. However, among five patients showing declines in semantic verbal fluency, only one patient's score declined by more than 2 SD. No patient showed significant decline or improvement in the overall level of cognitive functioning. This study supports the relative safety, in terms of cognitive function, of unilateral pallidal stimulation in PD. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Sismotherapy (ST) brings about numerous neurobiological changes, particularly changes in neuromediators and their receptors, second messengers, neuropeptides and neurotropic factors, a number of which are hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology or therapeutics of affective disorders (M. Fink). What is not yet known is which of these mechanisms is crucial for the psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. However, it is clear that the effects of ST tend to be relatively acute, and do not attack the deep-seated abnormalities that are the underlying causes of recurrences of affective disorders. This is corroborated by the fact that in animals, most of the effects of ECS on catecholamines and their receptors (and on receptors for benzodiazepines or neuropeptides such as TRH) tend to be relatively transient, and in most cases have been found to represent compensatory adaptations to the induced motor convulsions. However, recent preclinical data using attenuation, and clinical findings using reiterated transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), suggest that it may not be necessary to provoke a clonic convulsion in order to achieve the beneficial psychotropic and anticonvulsant effects of ST. In rodents receiving stimulation to the cerebellar tonsil, seven daily subacute low-frequency sessions (stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes) produced clear improvement in clonic convulsions and in post-discharge thresholds, together with durable inhibition of convulsions when stimulation was resumed (Weiss et al., 1995). Stimulation at 1 Hz for 15 minutes was more effective than stimulation at 10 or 20 Hz in attenuating convulsions. Although reiterated ECS also induced an anti-triggering effect, this dissipated rapidly over five days (Post et al., 1984). It is of great interest that recent publications have shown that rTMS at 10 or 20 Hz to the left frontal cortex, administered to patients suffering from refractory depression (George et al., 1995) or to patients (hospitalised or not) with milder degrees of depression (Pasquale-Leon et al., 1996), had a moderate or marked antidepressant effect. In these studies, rTMS showed few unwanted effects (other than mild pain in some patients, due to contraction of the temporal muscles); it did not induce motor convulsions, and did not, as such, appear to be associated with the memory loss described in subjective accounts or in preliminary neuropsychological tests (Little and Kimbrell et al., 1996). The optimal frequencies, durations and positions for rTMS to maximise its antidepressant effect still remain to be determined. However, the first controlled and open studies have tended to show that (because of the capacity of rapid magnetic fluxes to produce sub-convulsant electrical discharges that are relatively localised in the brain), rTMS may be found to be a clinically useful antidepressant model. This would suggest the possibility that some of the neurochemical changes induced by the clonic convulsions of ECS could be directly induced by stimulation at the very edge of the threshold (but still below it); this would open up the hope that one day these endogenous neurochemical processes could be identified and exploited in an optimal way for therapeutic purposes. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The development of multisensory neurons and multisensory integration was examined in the deep layers of the superior colliculus of kittens ranging in age from 3 to 135 d postnatal (dpn). Despite the high proportion of multisensory neurons in adult animals, no such neurons were found during the first 10 d of postnatal life. Rather, all sensory-responsive neurons were unimodal. The first multisensory neurons (somatosensory-auditory) were found at 12 dpn, and visually responsive multisensory neurons were not found until 20 dpn. Early multisensory neurons responded weakly to sensory stimuli, had long latencies, large receptive fields, and poorly developed response selectivities. Most surprising, however, was their inability to integrate combinations of sensory cues to produce significant response enhancement (or depression), a characteristic feature of the adult. Responses to combinations of sensory cues differed little from responses to their modality-specific components. At 28 dpn an abrupt physiological change was noted. Some multisensory neurons now integrated combinations of cross-modality cues and exhibited significant response enhancements when these cues were spatially coincident and response depressions when the cues were spatially disparate. During the next 2 months the incidence of multisensory neurons, and the proportion of these neurons capable of adult-like multisensory integration, gradually increased. Once multisensory integration appeared in a given neuron, its properties changed little with development. Even the youngest integrating neurons showed superadditive enhancements and spatial characteristics of multisensory integration that were indistinguishable from the adult. Nevertheless, neonatal and adult multisensory neurons differed in the manner in which they integrated temporally asynchronous stimuli, a distribution that may reflect the very different behavioral requirements at different ages. The possible maturational role of corticotectal projections in the abrupt gating of multisensory integration is discussed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The course of neural projection from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens in the rat. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Corticostriatal neurons linking the prefrontal cortex and the nucleus accumbens connect the terminal fields of the ascending mesotelencephalic dopamine neurons and may potentially mediate cortical dopaminergic modulation of subcortical dopamine transmission. In our attempt to develop a brain slice preparation that maximally preserves this prefrontal accumbens pathway for in vitro electrophysiological studies, knowledge of the complete course of its projection is critical. Microinjection of biotin-dextran amine as an anterograde tracer into the prefrontal cortex revealed the following in the coronal, sagittal and oblique planes of rat brain. (1) Axonal fibers from the rostral prelimbic cortex projected at an angle of approximately 60 degrees to the horizontal plane through the infralimbic region and mainly entered the rostromedial accumbens. Some also chose a ventral route to enter the &amp;quot;core&amp;quot; of the accumbens. (2) From the central ventral prelimbic regions, axons spread out diffusely and descended to the dorsal accumbens. They then entered throughout the rostral-caudal &amp;quot;shell&amp;quot; of the nucleus accumbens. (3) From the caudal prelimbic region of the prefrontal cortex, axonal fibers descended approximately 10 degrees to the coronal plane and entered the dorsal nucleus accumbens and the caudate nucleus. The denser caudate-projecting fibers gave rise to collaterals that entered the accumbens &amp;quot;core&amp;quot;. These results suggest that brain slices that preserve the rostral prelimbic-medial accumbens pathway can be obtained by an oblique (approximately 60 degrees) cut, whereas preservation of the caudal prefrontal-accumbens neurons necessitates a 10 degrees cut. Finally, in whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of accumbens neurons in such slices, orthodromically evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials to deep layer prefrontal cortical stimulation were observed, thus confirming the functional preservation of portions of this prefrontal cortex nucleus accumbens pathway. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Conduction time of the central motor pathways (CMCT) by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was performed within the first two weeks in 7 patients with isolated hemicerebellar lesions after stroke. Cerebellar infarcts were small (&amp;lt; 2 cm in diameter) in 5 patients and no brainstem structure was involved in CT studies. The threshold (3 cases) and CMCT (4 cases) were abnormal or asymmetric by stimulation of the motor cortex contralateral to the impaired hemicerebellum. The follow-up study in 2 patients revealed electrophysiological improvement closely related to clinical cerebellar recovery rate. CMCT was significantly longer by cortex stimulation contralateral to the impaired hemicerebellum than by ipsilateral stimulation. Prolonged CMCT was significantly correlated with the rated severity of cerebellar signs. Increased threshold may be due to depressed facilitating action of the deep cerebellar nuclei on contralateral motor cortex. Abnormal CMCT might result in reduced size and increased dispersion of the efferent volleys. Recovery of electrophysiological results could represent in part true potentially reversible functional deficit. Whichever the pathophysiological mechanisms involved, our results demonstrate that the cerebellum dysfunction plays a role in the abnormalities of CMCT elicited by TMS. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The role of the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus in the construction of the superior collicular auditory space map in the guinea-pig. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In the guinea-pig two subcortical structures have been shown to contain representations of auditory space, the deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) and the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX). The following investigation was undertaken to determine if the ICX influences the development of the SC auditory space map. A portion of the ICX was lesioned unilaterally when guinea-pigs were between 8 and 13 days old. Following a period of recovery, the SC mapping experiments commenced in the adult guinea-pig. Electrophysiological auditory responses were recorded from the deep layers of the SC to free-field azimuthal auditory stimulation. The data from the ICX lesioned animals revealed that the spatial tuning parameter values of the auditory receptive fields from the SC were significantly greater than those recorded in the normal control group of animals. The pooled data from the ICX lesioned group indicated that the peak angle of the response of the auditory receptive fields did not display normal topographic order. Furthermore, in several cases where the ICX lesion site was small, the position of the lesion could be correlated with the site of SC auditory space map disruption. These data indicate that, during early development, the presence of the ICX is essential for the normal emergence of an azimuthal map of auditory space in the deep layers of the guinea-pig SC. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. A goal of this study was to determine the sites in the diencephalon to which neurons in sacral spinal segments of rats project. Therefore, 95 neurons were recorded extracellularly in spinal segments L6-S2 of rats that were anesthetized with urethan. These neurons were activated initially antidromically with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA from a monopolar stimulating electrode placed into the contralateral posterior diencephalon. The mean +/- SE current for antidromic activation from these sites was 16 +/- 0.8 microA. These neurons were recorded in the superficial dorsal horn (4%), deep dorsal horn (89%), and intermediate zone and ventral horn (4%). 2. Systematic antidromic mapping techniques were used to map the axonal projections of 41 of these neurons within the diencephalon. Thirty-three neurons (80%) could be activated antidromically with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA only from points in the contralateral thalamus and are referred to as spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons. Eight neurons (20%) were activated antidromically with low currents from points in both the contralateral thalamus and hypothalamus, and these neurons are referred to as spinothalamic tract/ spinohypothalamic tract (STT/SHT) neurons. Three additional neurons were activated antidromically with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA only from points within the contralateral hypothalamus and are referred to as spinohypothalamic tract (SHT) neurons. The diencephalic projections of another 51 neurons were mapped incompletely. These neurons are referred to as spinothalamic/unknown (STT/ U) neurons to indicate that it was not known whether their axons ascended beyond the site in the thalamus from which they initially were activated antidromically. 3. For 31 STT neurons, the most anterior point at which antidromic activation was achieved with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA was determined. Fourteen (45%) were activated antidromically only from sites posterior to the ventrobasal complex (VbC) of the thalamus. Sixteen STT neurons (52%) were activated antidromically with low currents from sites at the level of the VbC, but not from more anterior levels. One STT neuron (3%) was activated antidromically from the anteroventral nucleus of the thalamus. 4. STT/SHT neurons were antidromically activated with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA from the medial lemniscus (ML), anterior pretectal nucleus (APt), posterior nuclear group and medial geniculate nucleus (Po/MG), and zona incerta in the thalamus and from the optic tract (OT), supraoptic decussation, or lateral area of the hypothalamus. No differences in the sites in the thalamus from which STT and STT/SHT neurons were activated antidromically were apparent. Five STT/SHT neurons (62%) were activated antidromically from points in the thalamus in the posterior diencephalon and from points in the hypothalamus at more anterior levels. Three STT/SHT neurons (38%) were activated antidromically with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA from sites in both the thalamus and hypothalamus at the same anterior-posterior level of the diencephalon. All three of these STT/SHT neurons projected to the intralaminar nuclei (parafascicular or central lateral nuclei) of the thalamus. 5. Seven STT/SHT neurons were tested for additional projections to the ipsilateral brain. Two (29%) were activated antidromically with currents &amp;lt; or = 30 microA and at longer latencies from sites in the ipsilateral diencephalon. One could only be activated antidromically from the hypothalamus ipsilaterally. The other was activated antidromically at progressively increasing latencies from points in the ipsilateral brain that extended as far posteriorly as the posterior pole of the MG. 6. Fifty-eight STT, STT/SHT, and STT/U neurons were classified as low-threshold (LT), wide dynamic range (WDR), or highthreshold (HT) neurons based on their responsiveness to innocuous and noxious mechanical stimuli applied to their cutaneous receptive fields.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We assessed whether subcortical structures can generate magnetic fields detectable outside the brain by first measuring the somatic evoked magnetic fields (SEFs) from a decorticated porcine preparation and then from an intact preparation. Strong SEFs were detected a few millimeters above the corpus callosum after electrical stimulations of the snout. The waveforms consisted of a large spike ( &amp;lt; or = 6 pT) with a peak latency of 11-18 ms depending on the age of the animal, followed by a slow wave. The waveform and latency of the SEF spike were virtually identical to those of the field potential within the brain. The SEF topography indicated that the underlying generator of the spike was in a region contralateral to the stimulation and inferior to the thalamus. The subcortical SEF was strong enough to be detectable even above the intact brain, after the cortically generated SEF was removed by ablation of the primary cortical area. The results indicate that a structure deep in the brain can produce remarkably strong magnetic fields detectable outside the brain. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Characterization of a forebrain gaze field in the archistriatum of the barn owl: microstimulation and anatomical connections. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We present evidence that the archistriatum in the forebrain of the barn owl participates in gaze control, that it can mediate gaze changes independently of the optic tectum (OT), and that it projects in parallel to both the OT and to saccade-generating circuitry in the brainstem tegmentum. These properties are similar to those of the frontal eye fields (FEF) in the prefrontal cortex of primates. The forebrain was surveyed for sites where electrical microstimulation would induce head saccades. Head (and eye) saccades were elicited from the anterior 70% of the archistriatum, a region that we refer to as the archistriatal gaze fields (AGF). At single stimulation sites in the AGF, saccade amplitude tended to vary as a function of stimulation parameters (current strength, pulse frequency, and train duration) and starting head position. In contrast, saccade direction was largely independent of these parameters. Saccade direction did vary over a wide range of primarily contraversive directions with the site of stimulation in the AGF. Using anatomical pathway tracing techniques, we found that the archistriatum projects strongly and in parallel to the deep layers of the OT and to nuclei in the midline brainstem tegmentum. Previous work has shown that electrical microstimulation of either of these brainstem regions evokes saccadic movements of the head and/or eyes (du Lac and Knudsen, 1990; Masino and Knudsen, 1992b). Inactivation of the OT with lidocaine reduced the size but did not eliminate (or change the direction of) the saccades evoked by AGF stimulation. The direct anatomical pathway from the archistriatum to the midline tegmental nuclei can account for saccades that persist following OT inactivation. The similarities between the AGF in barn owls and the FEF in primates suggest that the same general plan of anatomical and functional organization supports the contribution of the forebrain to gaze control in a wide variety of species. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Using an isolated turtle brain preparation, we made extracellular spike recordings in the dorsal midbrain during visual stimulation. Single units were isolated by their response to a slow-moving full-field visual pattern imaged on the contralateral retina. This stimulus elicits responses from the basal optic nucleus (BON) and the cerebellar cortex using a similar preparation. Direction and speed tuning were then analyzed, as well as the size and position of the receptive field. 2. In one brain stem region, anterior to the optic tectum and deep to the dorsal surface, all of the visually responsive neurons were direction sensitive (DS) to contralateral retinal stimulation. The location and properties of these cells indicate that they are in the mesencephalic lentiform nucleus (nLM). Anterograde transport of intravitreally injected horseradish peroxidase revealed that this pretectal nucleus receives direct input from the contralateral eye. 3. All but 2 of the 48 cells of the nLM were strongly DS. The most effective stimulus was a slowly moving complex visual pattern that drifted nasally in the contralateral visual field. Brief flashes of spots, patterns, or diffuse light were much less effective. Receptive fields were large and usually (9 of 13 cells) centered in the superior visual field near the horizon and nasal to the blind spot. 4. The visual responses of nLM cells were compared to those of cells in the superficial layers of the optic tectum. In contrast to nLM, the responses of tectal cells were heterogeneous and frequently not DS. Neither tectum or nLM cells had much spontaneous spike activity during darkness or stationary patterns. On the other hand, visual responses of nLM cells were very similar to those of the BON, where neurons also had low spontaneous activity, preferred slow-moving patterns, and were DS. However, nLM and BON exhibit different distributions of preferred directions. Most nLM cells preferred temporal-to-nasal motion, whereas BON cells preferred almost any direction, although few preferred the nasal direction. nLM cell responses were not affected by removal of the ventral brain stem including the BON. 5. The visual properties of nLM cells recorded in vitro were very similar to those that were recorded in intact turtles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A survey of spinal dorsal horn neurones encoding the spatial organization of withdrawal reflexes in the rat. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The withdrawal reflex pathways to hindlimb muscles have an elaborate spatial organization in the rat. In short, the distribution of sensitivity within the cutaneous receptive field of a single muscle has a spatial pattern that is a mirror image of the spatial pattern of the withdrawal of the skin surface ensuing on contraction in the respective muscle. In the present study, a search for neurones encoding the specific spatial input-output relationship of withdrawal reflexes to single muscles was made in the lumbosacral spinal cord in halothane/nitrous oxide-anaesthetized rats. The cutaneous receptive fields of 147 dorsal horn neurones in the L4-5 segments receiving a nociceptive input and a convergent input from A and C fibres from the hindpaw were studied. The spatial pattern of the response amplitude within the receptive fields of 118 neurones was quantitatively compared with those of withdrawal reflexes to single muscles. Response patterns exhibiting a high similarity to those of withdrawal reflexes to single muscles were found in 27 neurones located in the deep dorsal horn. Twenty-six of these belonged to class 2 (responding to tactile and nociceptive input) and one belonged to class 3 (responding only to nociceptive input). None of the neurones tested (n = 20) with reflex-like response patterns could be antidromically driven from the upper cervical cord, suggesting that they were spinal interneurones. With some overlap, putative interneurones of the withdrawal reflexes to the plantar flexors of the digits, the plantar flexors of the ankle, the pronators, the dorsiflexors of the ankle, and a flexor of the knee, were found in succession in a mediolateral direction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Spatially distributed responses induced by contrast reversal in cat visual cortex. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Field potentials were recorded from cat striate cortex, either between an epidural screw electrode and a cannula-electrode inserted deep in the gray matter (transcortical recording) or with a pair of metal microelectrodes. Electrodes were placed bilaterally near the cortical projection of the area centralis. The horizontal separation of the recording tips was approximately 2 mm and approximately 300 microns, respectively. The area of the visual field providing input to the recording site (receptive field) was determined by measuring the field potentials generated by contrast reversal of high-contrast, achromatic bar gratings. Five-degree-diameter grating patches were presented individually over a large area of the visual field. The gratings were contrast-reversed at 4, 6 or 10 Hz, while also being swept in spatial frequency between 0.56 and 5.24 c/deg. The receptive fields were approximately 20 deg across or more, substantially larger than expected on the basis of cortical retinotopy. Responses were also elicited by stimulation of the hemi-field contralateral to that contributing to the classical receptive field, implicating the presence of a callosal projection. The large, spatially distributed receptive fields consisted of patches of high and low sensitivity. Continuous cortical infusion of either 100 microM tetrodotoxin or 10 mM muscimol at the recording site totally suppressed the transcortically recorded field potentials, proving that the local field potentials were generated postsynaptically. The present findings suggest that a cluster of cortical cells near the projection site of the area centralis receives input from remote cortical regions to an extent that is comparable with that of anatomically demonstrated long-range lateral connections. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We used ordered arrangements of neuroblastoma cells in culture on chemically patterned substrates to direct the orientation of electrical stimulation with respect to cell alignment. Chemically patterned parallel lines of self-assembled monolayer films were fabricated on glass substrates via a deep UV lithographic procedure. Cultured neuroblastoma cells deposited on these substrates formed long (approximately 300 microns in length) neuritic processes along the patterned lines in the presence of retinoic acid. Cells attached to the surface of these substrates were placed in a stimulation chamber so that an electric field (1.4-1.9 V/cm) could be applied in the direction parallel or perpendicular to neuritic or orientation. A majority of cells aligned parallel to the orientation of electrical stimulation exhibited a variety of cellular responses including neuritic tip damage, reductions in neuritic length and varicosity formation. These effects were observed to a lesser degree on the cells when electrical stimulation with the same magnitude was applied perpendicularly to the cell alignment. This work supports earlier findings that geometry is a crucial factor in determining cellular response to applied electric fields and goes on to show that cellular orientation is a key factor in determining cellular damage in culture. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> We have performed single-neuron recording and microstimulation in the region of the thalamic principal sensory nucleus (ventrocaudal nucleus, Vc) prior to implantation of a deep brain-stimulating electrode in a patient with pain secondary to arachnoiditis and with a past history of unstable angina. Cells located in the 16 mm lateral plane had cutaneous receptive fields on the chest wall. At and posterior to the location of these cells stimulation coincided precisely with the sensation of angina (stimulation-associated angina). The description of stimulation-associated angina was measured using a questionnaire and was identical to the patient's usual angina except that it began and terminated suddenly. Stimulation-associated angina was coincident with a tingling sensation in the leg. Clinical, hemodynamic, electrophysiologic and biochemical measures of cardiac function showed no evidence of myocardial strain or injury related to stimulation-associated angina. Since cells in the region of the principle sensory nucleus of thalamus respond to cardiac injury in animals, the present results suggest that this region mediates the sensation of angina. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We have used slice culture of the entorhino-hippocampal system to investigate (1) whether nerve fibres which are cut postnatally are able to regenerate and (2) whether the regenerating fibres are able to establish correct selective target specificity in the formation of their terminal fields. Slices of tissue were taken in the horizontal plane through the caudo-ventral pole of the cerebral hemisphere of 9- to 10-day-old rats. Such slices maintain the entorhinal cortex in continuity with the hippocampus and intervening retrohippocampal areas. However, because of the dorsal inclination of the entorhino-hippocampal projection fibres in situ, the segments of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus contained within each individual horizontal slice were disconnected from each other. During subsequent culture, the formation of fibre connections between the entorhinal area and the hippocampal complex was studied by the extracellular and intracellular anterograde transport of biocytin or biotin dextran, the retrograde transport of biotin dextran or carbocyanine dyes, and by electrical stimulation and recording. For the first 24 h after taking the slice, there were no entorhinal projections beyond the deep white matter, and no fibres reached the hippocampus or dentate gyrus. After 3 days in culture a small number of growing fibres had perforated the subiculum and entered the target areas. Between 6 and 14 days these projections increased and matured. As in the normal adult brain, entorhinal layer II stellate cells projected correctly to the dentate gyrus and hippocampal field CA3, whereas layer III pyramidal cells projected to hippocampal field CA1 and the subiculum. The new fibres grew along both alvear and perforant pathways. Anterograde and retrograde labelling showed that the reciprocal projections from the pyramidal cells of the subiculum and CA1 to the entorhinal area had also been severed at the time of taking the slices, and had similarly regenerated. Our results demonstrate that by taking tissue slices in appropriate planes it is possible to study the regeneration of axons in the tissue environment through which they normally run. This approach avoids the use of coculture and the concomitant difficulties associated with the need for fibres to cross a coculture interface. In horizontal slices of postnatal tissue, severed fibre projections between the entorhinal cortex and the hippocampal complex can regenerate in both directions and re-establish their correct laminar, pathway and target specificity. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Although neurons responsive to jaw movements have been identified in most parts of the trigeminal brainstem nuclei, little is known about how this information is relayed to the thalamus and ultimately to the cortex for kinesthetic functions and sensorimotor integration. The present extracellular recording experiments showed that a substantial amount of movement-related information is relayed to the thalamus through the caudal part of subnucleus interpolaris (Vi) in adult cats. Vertical jaw displacements, natural mechanical stimuli, and electrical stimulation of the masseter nerve were used to determine the receptive fields and response properties of movement-related neurons. Movement-related responses were observed in 161 units. The receptive fields of these units were located in the masseter muscle, other deep structures, hairy skin, oral mucosa, or some combination of these structures (i.e., convergent). The latency of units responding to masseter nerve stimulation ranged from 1.0 msec to 20 msec, which suggested that some movement-related information was provided by smaller-diameter muscle afferents. Movement responses were either tonic or phasic. Tonic units showed continuous firing at some jaw position; some of these showed a &amp;quot;dynamic&amp;quot; response to jaw displacement. Phasic units were only active, or showed increased activity, when the jaw moved through a specific position. Seventy-one movement-related units were activated by stimulation from the contralateral ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus. Most of the brainstem recording sites were located in the dorsal part of Vi between the caudal pole of the facial motor nucleus and the obex. Neurons in caudal Vi may be important for facial kinesthesia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Magnetic trigeminal somatosensory responses from human subjects were recorded using a 14-channel magnetoencephalographic system. Sensory stimuli comprising a 15-ms vibration at frequencies of 50 Hz, 150 Hz and 250 Hz were given at randomized interstimulus intervals. Using a single dipole model, the neuronal sources of the evoked responses were determined, and mapped onto magnetic resonance images of each subject. Source localization analysis was based on the main peak of the averaged signal (M55). All of the sources were located deep in the anterior bank of the postcentral gyrus, corresponding to area 3b of somatosensory cortex SI. In all cases, the source for the upper lip was significantly higher in the vertical axis (0.6-1.1 cm) than for the lower lip, while the lower lip stimulation produced a larger response than the upper lip. Furthermore, statistically significant differences were found between the locations of the dipoles evoked by different frequency stimulation. The location of the response shifted with change in stimulation frequency, showing a trend among all subjects with medial shift between 150 and 250 Hz for both upper and lower lip. The accuracy of source localization calculated from magnetic fields ranged between +/- 0.9 and +/- 3.0 mm (SEM). These results demonstrate (1) that a large area of the somatosensory cortex is utilized for lip representation and (2) that the spatial displacement of the trigeminal somatosensory response may be related to the discrimination of frequency. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Microcircuitry of posterior cingulate cortex in vitro: electrophysiology and laminar analysis using the current source density method. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We used current source density (CSD) analysis of a laminar profile of subicular stimulus-evoked field potentials recorded in cortical slices in vitro to characterize the interlaminar microcircuitry of posterior cingulate cortex. Neuroanatomic and electrophysiologic data indicate that subiculocingulate tract (SCT) afferents monosynaptically excite apical dendrites of deep laminae (V-VI) neurons, evoking pure EPSPs, while superficial laminae (II/III-IV) neurons are driven polysynaptically, evoking a mixture of longer latency EPSPs and IPSPs. Consistent with this model, CSD analysis of field potential laminar profiles supports the conclusion that activation of excitatory subicular afferent terminal fields in superficial laminae of cingulate cortex elicits primary monosynaptic activation of apical dendrites of deep lamina (V-VI) pyramids. Subsequent EPSP propagation to the somata of these pyramids generated synchronous action potential discharges which appeared to elicit delayed polysynaptic activation of superficial laminae pyramids and interneurons. Latency differences between SCT-stimulus-evoked EPSPs and action potentials in superficial and deep laminae were minimized by stimulus train frequencies of 5-8 Hz, indicating that the proposed microcircuitry can show functional tuning at frequencies characteristic of hippocampal neuronal activity (theta). Such tuning suggests that hippocampal output activity frequency and phase locked to theta rhythm will be preferentially gated through cingulate cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The patterns and synaptic properties of horizontal intracortical connections in the rat motor cortex. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. The laminar distribution of synaptic activity in the primary motor cortex, elicited by stimulation of intracortical, horizontal afferents, was studied in young (12-17 days old) and adult rats using the in vitro brain slice preparation. Connectivity patterns were deduced from current-source density (CSD) analyses of field potential depth profiles and were confirmed by anatomic data of retrograde cell labeling after focal injections of a fluorescent tracer. 2. According to the CSD distributions, horizontal axons in layer II/III provide strong monosynaptic input to dendrites of layer II and III pyramidal cells in a distant column, and weaker monosynaptic input to layer V and VI cells by synapsing on dendritic fields at the border of layer III and V and in deep layer V. When these pathways are activated, layer II/III cells may relay excitatory activity to upper and deep layer V, as well as to other cells in layer II/III of the same column. Axons arising from layer V provide monosynaptic input to pyramidal cells in all layers of neighboring columns, by synapsing in two dendritic fields: one in the superficial layers and the other in middle layer V. Activation of these pathways may generate a disynaptic intracolumnar input from layer II/III cells to middle layer V, as well as to other cells in layer II/III. Similar patterns of synaptic activity were elicited by stimulation from 0.45 to 2 mm distal to the recorded column. There were no apparent differences between young and adult rats in the connectivity patterns revealed by the CSD analyses. 3. Tracer injections in layer III resulted in retrograde labeling of cells in layers II/III and V, at distances &amp;gt; 2 mm from the injection site, whereas injections in layer V resulted in retrograde labeling of cells at long distances in layer V and to a lesser extent in layer II/III. These findings indicate that neurons in layer V project, via horizontal axon collaterals, for long distances within layers III and V, whereas the horizontal axon collaterals of layer III cells are restricted, for the most part, to the superficial layers. 4. Suppression of inhibitory activity by bath application of the gamma-aminobutyric acid-A (GABAA) receptor antagonist bicuculline methiodide (BMI) did not alter the pattern of the CSD distributions. All synaptic currents present in the control medium were enhanced by application of BMI, although the effect was more pronounced on the polysynaptic components.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. In penetrations made into the upper bank of the lateral sulcus in two monkeys (Macaca mulatta), cells were isolated from the second somatosensory cortex (SII). During single-cell recordings, animals performed an active touch task in which they rubbed their fingertips over pairs of gratings differing in groove width and indicated which was the smoother surface. Hand motion and downward applied force were measured and recorded during these strokes. 2. In this survey, 151 penetrations provided observations on 352 cells that responded to passive stimulation of the digits or during performance of the active touch task. Consistent with previous reports, receptive fields (RFs) in SII were large, often multi-digit, and frequently included a portion or all of the hand and occasionally the arm. Modality was determined for 92 of 127 fully characterized cells, and included 70 cutaneous, 5 deep, 11 Pacinian corpuscle, and 6 joint cells. Characteristic of SII, modality could not be defined in 35 cells that were unresponsive to passive stimulation or whose responses varied widely over time. 3. Response properties of a subgroup of 79 cells in SII resembled those previously studied in the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and ventroposterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus (VPL) using identical procedures. Correlation analysis revealed that 29 of these cells, like a portion of cells in SI, responded to changes in groove width independent of force or velocity. This selectivity could be considered a form of feature specificity. 4. In contrast to SI and VPL, transient responses to the fingertips contacting small elevated metal bars, which demarcated the beginning, middle, and end of strokes across the gratings, were seen in a majority of SII cells (109/127). During contact with bars, 89 cells displayed excitatory responses and 20 cells showed suppressed activity. Twelve cells, which responded to bars in isolation from gratings, provided a possible example of increased stimulus selectivity. 5. Passive stimulation failed to activate 16 cells that responded, in some cases differentially to gratings or force, during the task. Responses of nine other cells demonstrated task-dependent modulation in the form of response reduction or enhancement during selected portions of the stroke. In these same cells, response changes did not occur under comparable stimulus conditions in other portions of the stroke that differed only in behavioral context. These types of selective response modulations, not noted in our previous studies of VPL or SI, suggest that mechanisms regulating sensory inputs may affect SII.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Efferents from the frontal eye fields (FEF) to the ipsilateral frontal lobe were studied by autoradiography of tritiated tracers (leucine, proline, and fucose) in seven macaque monkeys that were used previously to describe subcortical connections. In four of the cases, tracer injection sites were confirmed by low thresholds for the electrical elicitation of saccadic eye movements. Cases were grouped as lFEF of sFEF cases according to large or small saccades that were characteristic of the injection site. Projections from the FEF terminated in five frontal regions: 1) area FD on the dorsomedial convexity; 2) area FC (containing SEF) medial to the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus; 3) areas FD and FD delta along the walls of the principal sulcus; 4) area FCBm on the deep, posterior wall of the arcuate sulcus inferior to the sulcal spur; and 5) the inferolateral cortex (area FDi) on the convexity and lateral two thirds of the anterior wall of the arcuate sulcus. Projections in sFEF cases tended to be confined to medial parts of dorsomedial FD and FC and the lateral wall of the principal sulcus and inferolateral convexity. Neither lFEF nor sFEF appeared to project to the SMA or pericingulate cortex. Label in these areas was found only in the cases in which tracer spread into non-FEF areas. FEF projections terminated in column-like patches of about 500-600 microns in diameter.

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The aim of this study was to determine the discharge and receptive field properties of spinal cord neurons with ankle input in spinal segments L4-6 in the rat, both under control conditions and during the course of an adjuvant-induced unilateral inflammation in the ankle. The extent of receptive fields in the skin and deep tissue was assessed using brush, pinch and compression stimuli. Neurons were categorized as nociceptive-specific or wide-dynamic-range neurons on the basis of their response thresholds and responses to suprathreshold stimuli. At all stages of inflammation (2, 6, 13 and 20 days post inoculation) the population of neurons with ankle input showed differences from the population of neurons with ankle input in control rats. There was a reduction in the number of neurons that appeared as nociceptive specific and a concomitant increase in the number of neurons showing a wide-dynamic-range response profile. The receptive fields of the neurons with ankle input were markedly larger in rats with inflammation in the ankle region and mainly spread proximally on the ipsilateral hindlimb and also to the abdomen and tail in some cases. There was also an increase in the number of neurons with contralateral excitatory inputs. The mechanical thresholds at the ankle joint and proximal parts of the ipsilateral hindlimb were less in arthritic rats than in controls. The proportion of spontaneously active neurons was also increased in rats during the initial and later stages of inflammation, although there was no significant increase in the mean spontaneous discharge frequency. These data show that there are long-term changes in the receptive field and response properties of neurons in intact rats with chronic unilateral adjuvant-induced inflammation similar to those described previously in spinal cats with acute inflammation (Neugebauer and Schaible 1990). It is presumed that similar afferent and spinal mechanisms are at work under acute and chronic inflammatory conditions which produce hyperexcitability in spinal neurons with joint input. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Cats were prepared for chronic recording from neurons in pars oralis and pars interpolaris of the trigeminal spinal nucleus. Electrodes were implanted into canine teeth for electrical stimulation and the digastric muscle for recording electromyograms. 2. Recordings were made from the animals when they were awake and unrestrained as well as when they were lightly anesthetized. Some neurons were studied under both conditions. 3. In an awake animal, single tooth-pulp stimuli of 0.1 ms duration and &amp;lt; or = 1 mA intensity produced no aversive behavior. 4. The response of trigeminal brain stem neurons in the awake animal to such stimuli consisted of short (approximately 3 ms)- and long (approximately 25 ms)-latency discharges whose thresholds suggested that they were both due to inputs from fast conducting primary afferent fibers. 5. Light anesthesia reduced the number of impulses in both components and in most cases completely abolished the long-latency component evoked by low-intensity stimuli. The threshold of the short-latency component was little affected by light anesthesia. It is postulated that the short-latency component is mediated by a monosynaptic input from primary afferent fibers and the long-latency component by a polysynaptic input from these same fibers. 6. All neurons that responded to tooth-pulp stimulation had inputs from other orofacial sites both in the awake and lightly anesthetized states. After light anesthesia, these receptive fields were altered in only 3 out of 15 neurons. 7. The majority of neurons (18 out of 20) were not spontaneously active in the awake animal. Spontaneous activity in the other two was reduced by light anesthesia. 8. The threshold of the digastric reflex evoked by tooth-pulp stimulation was not altered by light anesthesia, but the size of the response was reduced. 9. The effects of changing the level of anesthesia from deep to light (i.e., without and with reflex withdrawal to squeezing a paw) on the responses to tooth-pulp stimulation were also studied. Decreasing the anesthetic depth tended to decrease the thresholds and increase the magnitude of both the short- and long-latency neuronal responses and the short-latency digastric response. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In cats and primates, area 3a of the somatosensory cortex is the primary recipient of proprioceptive input (Phillips et al., 1971). Neurons in area 3a project to area 2 (Pons and Kaas, 1986; Porter, 1991), where somatic input relayed from the cortex and the thalamus may be integrated (Iwamura and Tanaka, 1978a,c). The goal of the present study was to determine the effects of area 3a input on neuronal activity in area 2 of cats. Extracellular recording techniques were used to identify neurons in area 2 that responded to deep stimulation of the contralateral forepaw. Neurons in area 3a that responded to the same receptive field modality and location as those in area 2 were also isolated. Single-unit or multiunit responses and evoked potentials to electrical stimulation of the shared peripheral receptive field and spontaneous activity were recorded from areas 2 and 3a. Lidocaine, a local anesthetic, was injected at the area 3a recording site to block neuronal activity. Spontaneous activity and receptive fields were abolished and evoked potentials were considerably diminished at the injection site, immediately after lidocaine was administered. Changes in unit responses, spontaneous activity, and evoked potentials in area 2 were monitored following inactivation of the somatotopically &amp;quot;matched&amp;quot; site in area 3a. Unit activity was recorded at 15 matched sites. In area 2, changes in unit responses to the peripheral stimulation and/or in spontaneous activity were observed at most of the recording sites following inactivation of area 3a. Spontaneous activity rates changed at 63% of the sites (mean change = 85%). Unit responses to the peripheral stimulation changed at 57% of the recording sites (mean change = 47%). The remaining sites in area 2 did not show lidocaine-induced changes. These sites may not have been connected with the matched sites in area 3a. Spontaneous activity and unit responses were not always similarly altered at a given site; sometimes one increased while the other decreased. Decreases in unit responses and spontaneous activity following inactivation of area 3a input were the predominant effects, indicating that area 3a has a facilitatory effect on neuronal activity observed in some regions of area 2. However, increases in neuronal activity at some sites indicated that the effects of area 3a input on area 2 are nonuniform. Evoked potentials were recorded at 19 matched sites, before and after injection of lidocaine. Evoked potentials also changed at some area 2 recording sites following area 3a inactivation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> A bimodal map of space: somatosensory receptive fields in the macaque putamen with corresponding visual receptive fields. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The macaque putamen contains neurons that respond to somatosensory stimuli such as light touch, joint movement, or deep muscle pressure. Their receptive fields are arranged to form a map of the body. In the face and arm region of this somatotopic map we found neurons that responded to visual stimuli. Some neurons were bimodal, responding to both visual and somatosensory stimuli, while others were purely visual, or purely somatosensory. The bimodal neurons usually responded to light cutaneous stimulation, rather than to joint movement or deep muscle pressure. They responded to visual stimuli near their tactile receptive field and were not selective for the shape or the color of the stimuli. For cells with tactile receptive fields on the face, the visual receptive field subtended a solid angle extending from the tactile receptive field to about 10 cm. For cells with tactile receptive fields on the arm, the visual receptive field often extended further from the animal. These bimodal properties provide a map of the visual space that immediately surrounds the monkey. The map is organized somatotopically, that is, by body part, rather than retinotopically as in most visual areas. It could function to guide movements in the animal's immediate vicinity. Cortical areas 6, 7b, and VIP contain bimodal cells with very similar properties to those in the putamen. We suggest that the bimodal cells in area 6, 7b, VIP, and the putamen form part of an interconnected system that represents extra personal space in a somatotopic fashion. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Randomized and infrequent omissions during presentation of a steady train of visual stimulation produced distinctive wave forms of both the magnetic fields and electrical potentials. Electrical potentials at Pz showed a positive peak in response to the omitted stimuli which occurred on the average 445 msec after the time when a stimulus was anticipated. Analyses of the magnetic wave forms indicated that at least two separate sources appear to be active coincident with the electrical positive peak. One source localized in the occipital lobes in the vicinity of the visual cortex while the other source was located in the medial aspects of the temporal lobe or even deeper in the lateral thalamus. Judging from the calculated direction of current flow it appeared that the deep source would contribute greater potentials in the frontal areas of the scalp while the source in the occipital area would contribute to more posterior placement of electrodes, especially at Pz. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Experiments were carried out in chloralose-anesthetized cats to study the responses of neurons in the lateral thalamus to excitation of afferent fibres from the knee joint. 2. Single- and multi-unit recordings were made with tungsten electrodes in dorsoventral penetrations through the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) during electrical stimulation of the medial articular nerve (MAN) of the cat's knee joint at an intensity sufficient to excite slowly conducting unmyelinated fibers. The locations of the recording sites were verified by recovering electrolytic lesion sites in histological sections (Nissl and cytochrome oxidase staining). 3. The average earliest latency for excitation of thalamic responses was 19.1 +/- 8.5 (SD) ms (n = 50). The threshold for excitation of most thalamic units was found to correspond to peripheral joint afferent fibers of the A-delta group. 4. The majority of neurons responding to MAN stimulation were found to be dorsal or ventral to the low-threshold cutaneous hindlimb region of the lateral division of the VPL (stereotaxic coordinates: AP 9.0-11.5; ML 7.0-9.5). In the ventral periphery of the VPL, most neurons responding to MAN stimulation (11/14) were wide dynamic range (WDR) with a discrete cutaneous receptive field on the hindpaw digits. Six WDR neurons were found dorsal to the hindlimb VPL with a convergent receptive field on the hindlimb (but not hindpaw digits). No nociceptive-specific knee joint units were found. 5. Other neurons were found dorsal to the hindlimb VPL with large receptive fields often encompassing the whole contralateral leg, including skin and deep hindlimb structures, possibly in a region described as the dorsal portion of the posterior complex (POd). Some neurons were found with no receptive field. 6. This study provides the first observations on the responses of lateral thalamic neurons to stimulation of the MAN of the cat knee joint. These results demonstrate a central pathway conveying impulses from specific deep joint afferents of the MAN to the peripheral region of the VPL and overlying region known as the POd, regions implicated in the transmission of nociceptive information. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. The responses of cortical neurons evoked by cutaneous stimulation were investigated in the hand representation of cortical area 3a in adult owl monkeys that had been trained in a tactile frequency discrimination task. Cortical representations of the hands in these experimental hemispheres were compared with those representing the opposite, untrained hand, as well as with those representing a passively stimulated hand in a second class of control monkeys. 2. A large cutaneous representation of the hairy and glabrous skin surfaces of the hand emerged in area 3a in each trained hemisphere. 3. With the emergence of cutaneous responses recorded for neurons at many area 3a locations, the normally recorded deep receptor inputs were no longer evident at most of these locations. 4. There was a greater territory of representation of the small area of skin that was stimulated in the behavioral task in trained monkeys, when compared with the representations of corresponding skin sites in the opposite hemisphere of the same monkeys, or to the representations of equivalent skin sites stimulated in passively stimulated control monkeys. 5. There was great variability in the receptive-field properties of neurons responsive to cutaneous inputs among trained monkeys. In most recording sites within the representations of the behaviorally engaged hands, the cutaneous receptive fields were large, extending over a significant part of the glabrous or hairy surfaces of the hand. However, in one monkey, very small, topographically ordered cutaneous receptive fields were recorded over a wide zone of area 3a. 6. The physiologically defined borders between areas 3a and 3b were in register with the cytoarchitectonically defined borders between these two cortical areas in trained and in control monkeys. 7. This study demonstrates that there is a reorganization of the cutaneous and &amp;quot;deep&amp;quot; representation of hand in cortical area 3a, with the main change being an emergence of a large cutaneous representation and the parallel disappearance of a large part of the normal deep representation in this field. These changes are discussed in light of the possible functional roles of cortical area 3a. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The effects of kainic acid lesions of the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus on the sensory input to the intralaminar thalamus of the rat were determined. Ipsiversive circling and contralateral sensory neglect were consistently seen after lesion placement. Two to 7 days later, the intralaminar thalamus was systematically explored for extracellular mechanoreceptive unit responses to high threshold and low threshold stimuli. On the side ipsilateral to the lesion the number of responsive units was reduced by 51%. The loss was particularly marked for nociceptive units (80%), and low threshold and complex units with orofacial receptive fields (73%). This effect may involve a partial deafferentation of the intralaminar thalamus as well as altered excitatory thresholds of thalamic neurons. It is suggested that the functionally distinct direct tectothalamic projection as well as the indirect tecto-reticulo-thalamic pathway are implicated. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The intralaminar thalamus of anesthetized rats was explored for neurons activated by stimulation of the superior colliculus and responsive to sensory inputs. Neurons activated by stimulation of the intermediate and deep collicular layers were distributed throughout the intralaminar thalamus. Approximately one half of them responded to tectal as well as sensory inputs. The majority were nociceptive or had a more complex response pattern including responses to auditory stimulation. A small population of low threshold units had contralateral orofacial receptive fields and responded to light taps; these units were preferentially localized anteriorly in the central lateral and paracentral nuclei. Neurons responsive to tectal and sensory stimulation were randomly intermingled with other neurons which had no detectable sensory input. The results indicate that ascending projection neurons of the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus provide an input to functionally diverse subpopulations of intralaminar thalamic neurons. In view of its projections to motor cortex and basal ganglia, the intralaminar thalamus appears directly implicated in basal ganglia and superior colliculus related mechanisms of attention, arousal and postural orienting. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. The input-output connectivity, in cat, of tectoreticular (TRNs) and tectoreticulospinal (TRSNs) neurons [together called TR(S)Ns] suggests a role for these cells in the sensorimotor transformations necessary for controlling orienting behavior. Multimodal sensory information converges directly onto these tectal neurons, and they project to several brain stem and spinal cord centers involved in the control of eye- and head-orienting movements. In this and the following two papers, we describe the sensorimotor discharges of antidromically identified TR(S)Ns. Here we describe the process of localizing and identifying them, characteristics of both their antidromic and sensory responses, and effects of behavioral context on these responses. 2. In 13 alert, chronically prepared cats, a total of 293 neurons were antidromically identified from either the predorsal bundle (PDB) immediately rostral to abducens nucleus or the ventromedial funiculus of the spinal cord at the level of the first cervical vertebra (C1). The cell bodies of all identified TR(S)Ns were confined to the intermediate and deep laminae of the superior colliculus (SC). The antidromic nature of the action potential evoked by stimulating either the PDB or C1 was verified by the use of a number of established criteria, including collision testing. 3. The mean antidromic latency from the PDB (TRNs + TRSNs) was 0.84 +/- 0.59 (SD) ms (n = 217). The conduction velocities of all cells activated by PDB stimulation ranged from 4 to 40 m/s. The mean latency from C1 (TRSNs) was 1.03 +/- 0.52 ms (SD) (n = 64), whereas conduction velocities ranged from 14 to 80 m/s. 4. One hundred thirty-eight TR(S)Ns were studied long enough to yield significant data regarding their involvement in visuomotor-orienting behavior. Ninety-eight percent (130/133) of the TR(S)Ns tested for visual responses could be induced to discharge action potentials in response to some form of visual stimulation. The other three neurons remained silent, even in response to the most provocative stimuli. These silent neurons nevertheless were shown to be depolarized by visual stimuli. TR(S)Ns were occasionally tested for auditory and somatosensory responses and some were multimodal. 5. TR(S)Ns had visual receptive fields that conformed to the retinotopic map of the visual field that is represented within the SC. Cells found in the lateral SC had receptive fields located in the lower visual field, whereas neurons that were situated medially had receptive fields in the upper visual field. Cells found in the rostral SC had small fields that included a representation of the area centralis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

Area 3a, 3b, and 1 neurons with deep receptive fields (RFs) exhibited greater stimulus-related activity during the movement task than during the no-movement task. Area 3b neurons with cutaneous RFs were similarly enhanced during the movement task, whereas area 1 neurons with cutaneous RFs were less responsive to vibratory stimuli during the movement task. These results suggest that motor-set and/or selective attention may modulate the responsiveness of SI neurons to peripheral stimuli and that changes in sensory responsiveness in SI neurons differ as a function of their cortical location and RF type. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Activity in descending motor pathways after scalp electrical and magnetic brain stimulation of the motor cortex was recorded from the exposed cervico-medullary junction in six patients having trans-oral surgery of the upper cervical spine. Recordings during deep anaesthesia without muscle paralysis revealed an initial negative potential (D wave) at about 2 ms with electrical stimulation in five of the six patients. This was followed by a muscle potential which obscured any later waveforms. Magnetic stimulation produced clear potentials in only one patient. The earliest wave to magnetic stimulation during deep anaesthesia was 1-2 ms later than the earliest potential to electrical stimulation. Following lightening of the anaesthetic and the administration of muscle relaxants a series of later negative potentials (I waves) were more clearly seen to both electrical and magnetic stimulation. More I waves were recorded to magnetic stimulation during light anaesthesia than during deep anaesthesia. Increasing the intensity of electrical stimulation also produced an extra late I wave. At the highest intensity of magnetic stimulation the latency of the earliest potential was comparable to the D wave to electrical stimulation. The intervals between these various D and I waves corresponded to those previously described for the timing of single motor unit discharge after cortical stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> During 1984-1989, 19 Bedouin children, 4-8 years old, were hospitalized because of henbane plant (Hyoscyamus reticulatus) poisoning. There were 14 cases in the autumn, 3 in the spring and 2 in the summer. The most prominent signs were altered state of consciousness (including deep coma in 3) and flushed dry, warm skin in all. Pupils were dilated in 18 of the 19 and restlessness and hallucinations were present in 17. Less common were vomiting, increased tendon reflexes, convulsions, involuntary movements, ataxia, hypertension, hyperpyrexia and tachycardia. Therapy included intravenous physostigmine in 7 and sedatives (diazepam and triclofos) in 6. All were free of symptoms within 24 hours of admission. Henbane may grow as an annual or biennial. Renewed growth of leaf rosettes occurs before the first rains and they attract attention in the fields. The parts of the plant eaten by most of the children were the roots, which are easily mistaken for the edible roots of other plants. The main alkaloids in henbane are atropine (hyoscyamine) and scopolamine (hyoscine) which explains the clinical picture of mixed stimulation and depression of the brain. Educational measures should be undertaken to prevent poisoning of Bedouin children by eating such plants. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Single units were recorded using extracellular glass microelectrodes in all laminae of the superior colliculus of the rat under halothane nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Fifty-one units were encountered which responded to a low intensity mechanical stimulus applied to a contralateral or bilateral field located in the oral sphere (intraoral 11, perioral 16), on the face (29) or on the rest of the body (21). Sixteen units responded to a jaw movement. Sixty-one cells were recorded which were preferentially (10) or only (51) activated (30) or inhibited (21) by noxious stimuli. Contralateral or bilateral mechanoreceptive fields located in intraoral (34) and perioral (35) areas were frequent. There is therefore a high incidence of the nociceptive representation of the mouth in the superior colliculus. The other functional properties of the nociceptive units were similar to those reported in other studies. From the subsequent histological localization of the recorded units, it appeared that the nociceptive projections from the intraoral and perioral regions to the superior colliculus reach the lateral part of the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> An introduction to the basic principles of magnetic nerve stimulation. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Magnetic nerve stimulation is a new method for the noninvasive stimulation of neuromuscular tissue. The technique, developed at the University of Sheffield, United Kingdom, is being increasingly used for both clinical studies and basic research, with some 500 stimulators presently in use worldwide. This paper looks at the development of magnetic stimulation as a clinical tool. The basic physics principles of the technique are outlined, and the different magnetic field waveforms, coil geometrics, and orientations that can be used are discussed. The depth of penetration of magnetic stimulation is compared to that of conventional electrical stimulation using surface electrodes. It is shown that the former generates lower electric fields at the surface of the body, resulting in greater penetration and the ability to stimulate deep nerves without pain. Magnetic stimulation has several other advantages over electrical stimulation, including being able to stimulate the human brain without discomfort due to the magnetic fields passing through the skull without attenuation. These advantages, along with the limitations of the technique, are discussed. Finally, data relating to the safety of brain stimulation are summarised in terms of the electromagnetic parameters used. It is concluded that the present generation of magnetic stimulators do not cause acute hazards, provided their electrical and mechanical design meets the relevant electromedical safety standards. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Magnetic stimulators consist of a high-voltage (400 V to more than 3 kV), high-current (4 kA to more than 20 kA) discharge system producing a brief pulse of magnetic field (1-10 T lasting up to a few milliseconds). In order to ensure safety and reliability, care has to be taken in the construction of magnetic stimulators and especially their stimulating coils, which may come into contact with the patient, by the use of adequate mechanical and electrical insulation and the incorporation of sensors to monitor temperature, voltage, etc. Where possible, equipment should be manufactured to comply with safety standards such as UL504 and IEC601. The effectiveness of a magnetic stimulator depends on many parameters such as the maximization of the peak coil energy, fast magnetic field rise times, and good coil design. It is also important to choose a coil based on its intended clinical application and not simply on account of its high magnetic field strength. A small coil, producing a high surface magnetic field, is suitable in the stimulation of superficial nerves, whereas a larger coil, with a low magnetic field intensity, may well be more suitable for the stimulation of deep nerves. Double, figure-eight, or butterfly coils produce more localised induced currents allowing for more selective stimulation. The exposure of the brain to high magnetic field strengths can also be reduced by using larger coils. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Small iontophoretic injections of the lectin, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), were made into different layers of the primary auditory cortex (AI) of cats. Injections in layer I labeled two types of morphologically distinct fibers in layer I as well as a smaller number of axons in layers II and III. Layer II injections labeled descending axons that produced a dense plexus of terminal fibers in layers I-III of both AI and adjacent auditory fields. Injections in layer III also labeled a dense plexus of axon collaterals at the junction of layers V and VI and labeled patches of terminal fibers in both AI and adjacent auditory fields. These were densest in layers I-III but usually extended into layers IV and V as well. The patches were partly formed by axon collaterals of layer III pyramidal cells that traveled for over 4 mm in the gray matter. Injections confined to layer IV labeled axons in all layers of the cortex but none of these axons appeared to reach the white matter. The axons spread laterally in layer IV and up into the superficial layers and ramified especially layer I. Injections in layers V and VI labeled axons in all layers' of the cortex but these were densest in the deep layers where labeling was fairly homogeneous. In the upper layers the labeling was arranged in semi-discrete patches. Large injections involving layers I-III were studied in tangential sections. Between 3 and 8 patches of terminal labeling were observed in AI and these were mainly arranged in a band with its long axis aligned approximately in the dorsoventral direction. However dense patches of terminal labeling also occurred both anterior and posterior to the injection site. In selected experiments portions of the tonotopic map in AI were mapped by single unit recording and subsequently the map was related to patches of anterogradely labeled fibers that surrounded injections of PHA-L. Rows of dorsoventrally oriented patches were among cells with a similar best frequency to those in the injection site. However patches located anterior or posterior to the injection site were among cells with higher or lower best frequencies. Two injections of PHA-L close together produce different patterns of labeling. One of the injections usually produces one or more patches that has no correlate among the patches of fibers labeled by the adjacent injection. This is clearest when one of the injections is made with biotinylated PHA-L that can be visualized directly without the use of primary antibodies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The origin and laminar arrangement of the homolateral and callosal projections to the anterior (AAF), primary (AI), posterior (PAF) and secondary (AII) auditory cortical areas were studied in the cat by means of electrophysiological recording and WGA-HRP tracing techniques. The transcallosal projections to AAF, AI, PAF and AII were principally homotypic since the major source of input was their corresponding area in the contralateral cortex. Heterotypic transcallosal projections to AAF and AI were seen, originating from the contralateral AI and AAF, respectively. PAF received heterotypic commissural projections from the opposite ventroposterior auditory cortical field (VPAF). Heterotypic callosal inputs to AII were rare, originating from AAF and AI. The neurons of origin of the transcallosal connections were located mainly in layers II and III (70-92%), and less frequently in deep layers (V and VI, 8-30%). Single unit recordings provided evidence that both homotypic and heterotypic transcallosal projections connect corresponding frequency regions of the two hemispheres. The regional distribution of the anterogradely labeled terminals indicated that the homotypic and heterotypic auditory transcallosal projections are reciprocal. The present data suggest that the transcallosal auditory interconnections are segregated in 3 major parallel components (AAF-AI, PAF-VPAF and AII), maintaining a segregation between parallel functional channels already established for the thalamocortical auditory interconnections. For the intrahemispheric connections, the analysis of the retrograde tracing data revealed that AAF and AI receive projections from the homolateral cortical areas PAF, VPAF and AII, whose neurons of origin were located mainly in their deep (V and VI) cortical layers. The reciprocal interconnections between the homolateral AAF and AI did not show a preferential laminar arrangement since the neurons of origin were distributed almost evenly in both superficial (II and III) and deep (V and VI) cortical layers. On the contrary, PAF received inputs from the homolateral cortical fields AAF, AI, AII and VPAF, originating predominantly from their superficial (II and III) layers. The homolateral projections reaching AII originated mainly from the superficial layers of AAF and AI, but from the deep layers of VPAF and PAF. The laminar distribution of anterogradely labeled terminal fields, when they were dense enough for a confident identification, was systematically related to the laminar arrangement of neurons of origin of the reciprocal projection: a projection originating from deep layers was associated with a reciprocal projection terminating mainly in layer IV, whereas a projection originating from superficial layers was associated with a reciprocal projection terminating predominantly outside layer IV.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Bilateral interaction in the second somatosensory area (SII) of the cat and contribution of the corpus callosum. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> There are indications in the literature that convergent ipsilateral and contralateral input to the second somatosensory area (SII) may interact. Single unit activity of SII bilateral cells was studied to evaluate the impact of simultaneous bilateral stimulation of the receptive fields (RF) on neural discharge. The cellular responses to unilateral ipsilateral and contralateral, as well as to bilateral stimulation were compared. 22% of bilateral cells showed interaction, usually facilitation. Bilaterally evoked responses were found to be as great as 250% of the strongest unilateral response. Only bilateral responses stronger or weaker than the dominant unilateral response by at least 50% were considered as interactive. The great majority of interactive cells had their RF on the forelimb and were responsive to deep stimulation. The corpus callosum appears to be responsible for part of the observed interaction since in callosotomized cats only 5% of bilateral cells were interactive. A non-callosal ipsilateral pathway must be postulated because both bilaterality and bilateral interaction persist to some degree after callosotomy. A putative role for bilateral interaction in sensory-motor integration is discussed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neurons of the rat superior colliculus projecting to the intralaminar thalamus were tested for their responses to somatosensory stimulation. They were identified by antidromic stimulation of the parafascicular nucleus and central lateral nucleus. To establish the existence of descending as well as ascending axon collaterals antidromic stimulation was applied to the upper cervical spinal cord in some cases. Somatosensory receptive fields were delineated and their laminar location in the superior colliculus was noted. Units were distributed throughout the intermediate and deep tectal layers, none were located in the superficial layers. Units with somatosensory receptive fields could be classified as low threshold, high threshold, wide dynamic range or complex. The majority of the peripherally responsive units (52%) were low threshold somatosensory units with contralateral receptive fields. All units were distributed throughout the intermediate and deep layers. Their distribution reflected the typical somatotopic organization of the superior colliculus. These results indicate that the intralaminar thalamus receives some sensory information by way of the tectum. In turn, the basal ganglia may gain direct access to this information by way of the thalamoneostriatal projection. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Somatosensory input to 431 neurons in MsI has been studied in unanesthetized, paralyzed raccoons (Procyon lotor). The type of sensory input to neurons in lateral sigmoid gyrus (cytoarchitectonic area 4) and in posterior sigmoid gyrus (areas 4 and 3a) was not significantly different. Of these neurons, 36% were activated by superficial cutaneous stimulation (touch, tap or hair deflection) and 26% by deep stimulation (pressure or joint movement). Mute neurons (not driven by any form of peripheral stimulation tested, or vaguely driven) comprised 38% of the sample. Only 4% of anterior sigmoid gyrus (area 6) neurons responded to superficial or deep stimulation; 96% were mute. The majority of MsI neurons had small (less than or equal to 20 cm2) peripheral receptive fields (PRFs). There was a statistically significant trend for PRF size to decrease along the proximal-distal axis of the forelimb. The area of MsI digit PRFs was significantly larger than the area of SmI digit PRFs. Comparing the data for raccoon MsI with information from the literature for cats and monkeys suggests that the type and amount of somesthetic afferent input to forelimb MsI is related to the behavioral uses to which each animal puts the forelimb. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Supplementary eye field as defined by intracortical microstimulation: connections in macaques. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In macaques, the frontal eye field and the recently defined supplementary eye field play a role in the production of eye movements. Whereas the structure and function of the frontal eye field are well understood, little is known about the supplementary eye field. The goal of this study was to determine the connections of the physiologically defined supplementary eye field. In each case, the location of the supplementary eye field was determined by using intracortical microstimulation, the borders were marked with small electrolytic lesions, and horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin was injected into the supplementary eye field. After the tissue was incubated with tetramethyl benzidine, it was determined that in three cases the injection site was confined to the physiologically defined supplementary eye field. The present results indicate that the supplementary eye field is reciprocally connected with the claustrum, ventral anterior nucleus, including pars magnocellularis, nucleus X, posterior subdivision of the ventral lateral nucleus, multiform, parvocellular, magnocellular, and densocellular subdivisions of the medial dorsal nucleus, central lateral nucleus, parafascicular nucleus, and suprageniculate-limitans complex. The supplementary eye field projects to the putamen, caudate, reticular nucleus of the thalamus, central densocellular nucleus, zona incerta, subthalamic nucleus, rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus, parvocellular part of the red nucleus, intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus, central gray, cuneiform nucleus, mesencephalic reticular formation, pontine gray, nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and nucleus reticularis pontis oralis. The supplementary eye field is reciprocally and bilaterally connected with periprincipal and inferior prefrontal cortex, with periarcuate cortex, including the frontal eye field, the frontal ventral region, and with postarcuate premotor cortex, and cortex surrounding the supplementary eye field, including the supplementary motor area. The supplementary eye field is also reciprocally connected ipsilaterally with cortex in and around the cingulate sulcus and the intraparietal sulcus, whereas cortex within the superior temporal sulcus projects to the supplementary eye field. The connections of the physiologically defined supplementary eye field are compared to previously demonstrated connections of the supplementary motor region and of the physiologically defined frontal eye field. Comparisons between the connections of the frontal and supplementary eye fields reveal that both regions are connected with structures related to visuomotor functions, but the frontal eye field has more extensive connections with vision-related structures, and the supplementary eye field has more extensive connections with structures related to prefrontal and skeletomotor functions. Such connectional differences suggest functional differences between these two sensorimotor regions of the frontal lobe. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mapping the effects of motor cortex stimulation on somatosensory relay neurons in the rat thalamus: direct responses and afferent modulation. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Single unit recordings were used to map the spatial distribution of motor (MI) cortical influences on thalamic somatosensory relay nuclei in the rat. A total of 215 microelectrode penetrations were made to record single neurons in tracks through the medial and lateral ventroposterior (VPM and VPL), ventrolateral (VL), reticular (nRt), and posterior (Po) thalamic nuclei. Single units were classified according to their: 1) location within the nuclei, 2) receptive fields, and 3) response to standardized microstimulation in deep layers of the forepaw-forelimb areas of MI cortex. For mapping purposes, only short latency (1-7 msec) excitatory neuronal responses to the MI cortex stimulation were considered. Percentages of recorded thalamic neurons responsive to the MI stimulation varied considerably across nuclei: VL: 42.6%, nRt: 23.0%, VPL: 15.7%, VPM: 9.3%, and Po: 3.9%. Within the VPL, most responsive neurons were found in &amp;quot;border&amp;quot; regions, i.e., areas adjacent to the VL, and (to a lesser extent) the nRt and Po thalamic nuclei. The same parameters of MI cortical stimulation were used in studies of corticofugal modulation of afferent transmission through the VPL thalamus. A condition-test (C-T) paradigm was implemented in which the cortical stimulation (C) was delivered at a range of time intervals before test (T) mechanical vibratory stimulation was applied to digit No. 4 of the contralateral forepaw. The time course of MI cortical effects was analyzed by measuring the averaged evoked unit responses of the thalamic neurons to the T stimuli, and plotting them as a function of C-T intervals from 5-50 msec. Of the 30 VPL neurons tested during MI stimulation, the average response to T stimulation was decreased a mean 43%, with the suppression peaking at about 30 msec after the C stimulus. This suppression was more pronounced in the VPL border areas (-52% in areas adjacent to VL and nRt) than in the VPL center (-25%). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. The effects of electrical stimulation at different rostrocaudal levels of the midbrain, and at sites in the rostral medulla ipsilateral and contralateral to spinal recording sites, were evaluated against the responses of 46 cells belonging to the cat spinomesencephalic tract (SMT). 2. Inhibitory and/or excitatory effects of brain stem stimulation were observed on SMT cells that responded best (26 cells) or exclusively (12 cells) to noxious mechanical or thermal stimuli, as well as on 7 cells responding only to tap and/or stimulation of deep tissues. Recording sites for 32 cells were located in laminae V-VIII (27 cells) and laminae I-III (5 cells). 3. Midbrain stimulation sites were located in the superior colliculus, central gray (CG), red nucleus, and the midbrain reticular formation. Both inhibitory-only and excitatory-only effects were observed, although the most common effect of midbrain stimulation was excitation followed by inhibition (mixed effects). The effects of stimulation at different midbrain levels were determined for each cell. Stimulation in the caudal, middle, or rostral midbrain was often found to exert different effects on the same SMT cell. 4. Stimulation in the rostral medulla at sites located in nucleus raphe magnus (NRM), nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, and nucleus reticularis magnocellularis produced the same complement of effects observed with midbrain stimulation. Excitation followed by inhibition was the most common effect observed. 5. Stimulus intensities required to produce excitatory or inhibitory effects from midbrain were 114 +/- 85 (SD) microA and 210 +/- 91 microA, respectively. Stimulus currents required to produce excitatory or inhibitory effects from medullary stimulation sites were 124 +/- 56 microA and 70 +/- 60 microA, respectively. The mean currents required to produce mixed effects were 221 +/- 120 microA (midbrain) and 127 +/- 71 microA (medulla). Increasing the stimulus intensity used to evaluate brain stem effects increased the magnitude and duration of effects for 33 cells. Mixed effects were observed on 11 cells at stimulus intensities greater than those required to produce inhibitory-only effects. 6. Significant differences were found between the latencies of excitation and inhibition produced from different brain stem levels. These differences suggest that midbrain and medullary stimulation activate descending pathways with a wide range of conduction velocities and/or supraspinal and spinal connectivities. 7. The spinal trajectory of pathways contributing to the varied effects of brain stem stimulation as well as the complex receptive fields (RFs) of SMT cells were evaluated by the placement of lesions in the cervical spinal cord.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Multiple microelectrode maps of the hand representation within and across the borders of cortical area 3b were obtained before, immediately after, or several weeks after a period of behaviorally controlled hand use. Owl monkeys were conditioned in a task that produced cutaneous stimulation of a limited sector of skin on the distal phalanges of one or more fingers. 2. Analysis of microelectrode mapping experiment data revealed that 1) stimulated skin surfaces were represented over expanded cortical areas. 2) Most of the cutaneous receptive fields recorded within these expanded cortical representational zones were unusually small. 3) The internal topography of representation of the stimulated and immediately surrounding skin surfaces differed greatly from that recorded in control experiments. Representational discontinuities emerged in this map region, and &amp;quot;hypercolumn&amp;quot; distances in this map sector were grossly abnormal. 4) Borders between the representations of individual digits and digit segments commonly shifted. 5) The functionally defined rostral border of area 3b shifted farther rostralward, manifesting either an expansion of the cutaneous area 3b fingertip representation into cortical field 3a or an emergence of a cutaneous input zone in the caudal aspect of this normally predominantly deep-receptor representational field. 6) Significant lateralward translocations of the borders between the representations of the hand and face were recorded in all cases. 7) The absolute locations--and in some cases the areas or magnifications--of representations of many skin surfaces not directly involved in the trained behavior also changed significantly. However, the most striking areal, positional, and topographic changes were related to the representations of the behaviorally stimulated skin in every studied monkey. 3. These experiments demonstrate that functional cortical remodeling of the S1 koniocortical field, area 3b, results from behavioral manipulations in normal adult owl monkeys. We hypothesize that these studies manifest operation of the basic adaptive cortical process(es) underlying cortical contributions to perception and learning. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cell structure and response properties in the trigeminal subnucleus oralis. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Extra- and intracellular recording, electrical stimulation, receptive field mapping, and horseradish peroxidase injection techniques were used to study the structure of functionally identified neurons in trigeminal (V) brainstem subnucleus oralis of the rat. Of 15 heavily labeled cells located within oralis, 4 were local-circuit neurons with receptive fields restricted to either an incisor, guard hairs, one vibrissa, or deep facial tissue (nociceptors). Their morphologies were highly varied, with expansive and spiny dendritic trees and recurrent and intersubnuclear axon collaterals. Oralis local-circuit neurons therefore most closely resembled non-vibrissa-sensitive local-circuit cells in adjacent subnucleus interpolaris. Six other stained cells projected to contralateral thalamus, and two others projected to ipsilateral cerebellum. They typically had intramodality convergent receptive fields (i.e., spanning more than one receptor organ, such as multiple vibrissae or teeth) with widespread dendritic trees, and were therefore indistinguishable from similarly projecting cells in interpolaris. Two other cells projected to the ipsilateral spinal cord, as well as other V brainstem subnuclei. One of these responded to high-threshold mechanical stimulation of teeth; the other was discharged by deflection of one mystacial vibrissa. Their dendrites were very widespread and ended in spiny and bulbous appendages. Local axon collaterals were also extensive. The remaining oralis cell had two axons, one projecting to the thalamus, the other to the spinal cord. Its receptive field expressed convergence from multiple receptor organs, including vibrissae, guard hairs, and skin. Its somadendritic morphology was similar to that of oralis cells projecting only to thalamus. We conclude that, with some exceptions, the extensive dendritic trees, axon branching, convergence, and functional diversity of oralis cells approximate those described previously for functionally equivalent neurons in interpolaris (Jacquin et al., 1989a,b). Such anatomical and physiological properties are rarely seen, however, in nucleus principalis (Jacquin et al., 1988a). The structure and function of three atypical principalis cells with structural and functional characteristics typical of oralis cells are also described. It is argued that such cells are rostrally displaced oralis cells. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Mapping the effects of SI cortex stimulation on somatosensory relay neurons in the rat thalamus: direct responses and afferent modulation. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We have used single-unit recording techniques to map the spatial distribution of the primary somatosensory (SI) cortical influences on thalamic somatosensory relay nuclei in the rat. A total of 193 microelectrode penetrations were made to record single neurons in tracks through the medial and lateral ventroposterior (VPL and VPM), ventrolateral (VL), posterior (Po), and reticular (nRt) thalamic nuclei. Single units were classified according to their (1) location within the nuclei, (2) receptive fields, and (3) response to standardized microstimulation in deep layers of the SI cortical forepaw areas. The SI stimulation produced short-latency (1- to 7-msec) excitatory responses in different percentages of neurons recorded in the following thalamic nuclei: VPL, 42.0%; Po, 25.0%; nRt, 16.4%; VL, 13.6%; and VPM, 9.9%. Within the VPL, the highest proportion of responsive neurons was found in the anterior region. Although most of the VL region was unresponsive, the caudal subregion bordering the rostral VPL showed some responsiveness (13.6% of neurons). In general, the spatial pattern of corticothalamic influences appeared to reciprocate the known thalamocortical connection patterns, but with a heterogeneity that was unpredicted. The same parameters of SI cortical stimulation were used in studies of corticofugal modulation of afferent transmission through the VPL thalamus. A condition-test (C-T) paradigm was implemented in which the cortical stimulation (C) was delivered at a range of time intervals before test (T) mechanical vibratory stimulation was applied to digit 4 of the contralateral forepaw. The time course of cortical effects was analyzed by measuring the averaged evoked unit responses of thalamic neurons to the T stimuli, and plotting them as a function of C-T intervals from 5 to 50 msec. Of the 20 VPL neurons tested during SI stimulation, the average response to T stimulation was decreased a mean of 36%, with the suppression peaking (at 49% inhibition of the afferent response) about 15 msec after the C stimulus. Considerable rostrocaudal variation was observed, however. Whereas neurons in the rostral VPL (near VL) were strongly inhibited (-69%), neurons in the middle and caudal VPL exhibited facilitations at long and short C-T intervals, respectively. This study establishes a specific projection system from the forepaw region of SI cortex to different subregions of the VPL thalamus, producing specific temporal patterns of sensory modulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fifty-five neurons responsive to colorectal distension located in the superficial spinal dorsal horn (0.0-0.3 mm ventral to the cord dorsum) of the T13-L2 spinal segments of pentobarbital-anesthetized, physiologically intact or spinalized (C1 transection), decerebrate rats were characterized. These neurons could be separated into three groups based upon their response to an 80 mm Hg, 20 s colorectal distension: (1) short latency-abrupt (SL-A) neurons (n = 22) that were excited by colorectal distension at a short latency (less than 1 s) and abruptly terminated responses following the termination of the distending stimulus; (2) short latency-sustained (SL-S) neurons (n = 26) that were excited by colorectal distension at a short latency (less than 1 s) and demonstrated sustained responses (greater than 4 s) following termination of the distending stimulus; and (3) INHIB neurons (n = 7) that were spontaneously active and were inhibited by colorectal distension. All 55 neurons had convergent cutaneous receptive fields (i.e. were 'viscerosomatic'), exhibiting excitatory responses to noxious (pinch/heat) and/or non-noxious (brush) stimuli. Neurons excited by colorectal distension also demonstrated monotonic, accelerating responses to graded colorectal distension, were excited by the intraarterial administration of bradykinin, could be antidromically activated by electrical stimulation in the caudal ventrolateral medulla and were subject to tonic descending inhibitory modulation as evidenced by more vigorous responses to distension when rats were reversibly spinalized using a cold block.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The major aim of this study was to define the topography of descending motor cortical influences on the dorsal column nuclei of the rat. A total of 1442 single neurons were recorded throughout the rat cuneate (Cu) or external cuneate (ECu) nuclei and classified according to their: 1) location within the nuclei, 2) receptive fields, and 3) response to standardized deep layer microstimulation in the forelimb area of the motor (MI) cortex. Excitatory neuronal responses to this MI cortical stimulation ranged in latency from 2-28 msec, with 80% of responses in the 4-12 msec range. Overall, the rostral extremity of the Cu (0.5-1.0 mm rostral to the obex), and the ECu contained the highest percentage of recorded neurons responding to the MI cortical stimulation (61%). By contrast, only 11% responded in the middle subregion of the Cu (+0.4 to -0.9 mm relative to the obex), and 28% responded in the caudal-most subregion (1.0-2.0 mm caudal to obex). A similar paradigm was used to investigate the topography of MI corticofugal modulation of afferent transmission through the Cu and ECu. The MI cortical stimulation was used as a conditioning (C) stimulus in a condition-test (C-T) paradigm in which the test (T) stimulus was standardized mechanical vibration of digit No. 4 of the contralateral forepaw. A total of 30 cells from different subregions were analyzed by measuring the averaged evoked unit responses to the T-stimuli, and plotting them as a function of C-T intervals from 0-50 msec.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Renal and somatic input to spinal neurons antidromically activated from the ventrolateral medulla. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Studies were done to characterize responses of spinal neurons backfired from the ventrolateral medulla to renal and somatic stimuli. Experiments were performed on 31 cats that were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. Sixty-six spinal neurons were antidromically activated from the area of the lateral reticular nucleus or the ventrolateral reticular formation just rostral to the lateral reticular nucleus contralateral to the recording site. These cells could not be backfired from the medial reticular formation or from the spinothalamic tract just caudal to the thalamus. 2. Cells were located in laminae I, V, and VII of the T12-L2 segments. Antidromic conduction velocities averaged 35.9 +/- 7.2 m/s. Conduction velocities were unrelated to the projection site or laminar location of the cells. Termination sites of 21 cells were located in antidromic mapping experiments. Terminals were localized to the ventrolateral reticular formation, including the lateral reticular nucleus. 3. Responses to electrical stimulation of the renal nerves were always excitatory. Stimulation of renal A-delta-fibers excited 33 cells. These cells failed to respond to stimulation of renal C-fibers. The other 33 cells responded to both A-delta- and C-fiber stimulation. Latencies to A-delta-fiber stimulation averaged 9 +/- 2 ms, whereas latencies to C-fiber stimulation averaged 57 +/- 10 ms. 4. Renal mechanoreceptors were activated by occlusion of the renal vein or upper portion of the ureter. Renal vein occlusion excited 14 of 32 cells tested. Activity increased from 6 +/- 2 to 14 +/- 4 spike/s. Ureteral occlusion increased activity of 19 of 32 cells from 7 +/- 2 to 16 +/- 5 spikes/s. Cells responding to one of the mechanical stimuli were significantly more likely to receive A-delta-and C-fiber input compared with nonresponding cells. Nonresponders were more likely than responders to receive only A-delta input. 5. All cells received somatic input in addition to renal input. Twelve cells were classified as wide dynamic range, 46 as high threshold, and 8 as Deep. Somatic receptive fields most often included skin and muscle of the left flank and abdomen. Thirty-two cells had bilateral receptive fields, and 22 had inhibitory fields in addition to excitatory fields. 6. These data show that spinal neurons projecting to the ventrolateral medulla receive convergent inputs from the kidney and somatic structures. These cells may participate in a variety of functions including autonomic reflexes of renal origin. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. The responses of 90 cortical neurons in the somatosensory and gustatory areas were recorded with chronically implanted fine wires in freely moving Wistar rats. The responses were analyzed mainly while the animals were freely licking solutions and eating dry pellets. Cortical neurons were classified into several groups according to their response properties. 2. &amp;quot;Mechanosensitive&amp;quot; neurons (n = 20) showed rhythmic phasic activity in different phases of the licking cycle, depending on the location of their receptive field in the peripheral orofacial region. 3. &amp;quot;Movement-related&amp;quot; neurons (n = 27) changed their activities tonically during licking, chewing, or grooming behavior. The responses were either excitatory or inhibitory. Receptive fields and adequate stimuli could not be identified. These neurons might receive somatosensory (except light tactile) inputs from wide or deep areas of intra- or perioral regions, or might be related to orofacial active movement. 4. &amp;quot;Taste&amp;quot; neurons (n = 35) increased or decreased their discharge rates during licking of particular taste solutions. Some taste neurons received convergence from somatosensory inputs. 5. &amp;quot;Temperature&amp;quot; neurons (n = 2) responded exclusively to water of temperatures lower or higher than room temperature. The responses were opposite in direction between cold and warm stimuli. 6. &amp;quot;Anticipation&amp;quot; neurons (n = 4) increased their impulse discharges before the start of licking in the situation in which the animal expected access to the drinking tube. 7. &amp;quot;Attention&amp;quot; neurons (n = 2) responded to arousal stimulation such as sound, a flash of light, and body touch. These neurons showed only a slightly increasing response during ingestive behavior. 8. The locations of 56 of 90 units were histologically identified. Mechanosensitive neurons were located in the appropriate parts of the somatotopic pattern within the primary somatic sensory area in the granular cortex. Taste neurons were found evenly in the dysgranular cortex and the agranular insular cortex. Other types of neurons were located mainly in the dysgranular cortex between the granular cortex and agranular insular cortex, and some were intermingled with taste neurons in the agranular insular cortex. 9. The present study has shown that cortical neurons in the orolingual somatosensory and taste areas have different response characteristics related to each aspect of ingestive behavior.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Recordings were made from 545 neurons in somatosensory granular cortex of anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Of this sample, 32% were active spontaneously. Active neurons were not distributed uniformly throughout cortex but were most common in layer V. The highest mean spontaneous discharge frequency also was found in this layer. Cells with the lowest rates of spontaneous activity were located immediately above and below. One subset of spontaneously active neurons was characterized by an unusually high discharge frequency modulated by somatic stimulation. 2. Only 25.8% of the 534 neurons tested in granular cortex could be activated by somatic stimuli. Only 9.4% had cutaneous receptive fields, and 2.4% received deep inputs. The remainder (14.0%) were driven by higher intensity stimuli and could not be classified unequivocally as either cutaneous or deep. The 50 neurons with cutaneous receptive fields were located in the middle third of the cortex, and those with the largest receptive fields were found most superficially. Neurons driven by somatic stimuli were found most frequently in layer Vb, where 44.5% of the sample confirmed histologically to be in layer Vb could be excited. 3. The large proportion of neurons lacking demonstrable somatic inputs was attributed to the use of iontophoretically administered glutamate, which allowed the detection of many unresponsive neurons. This proportion was not reduced by the use of nitrous oxide and halothane as an anesthetic. 4. Neurons activated only by deep inputs were found on the medial and rostral edge of the hindlimb granular cortex, suggesting that deep and cutaneous inputs may be segregated in this species. 5. Electrical stimuli applied to the foot pads activated a sample of neurons differing from those driven by natural somatic stimuli in terms of depth, spontaneous activity, probability of somatic input, and probability of activation by the pyramidal tract. 6. Pyramidal tract neurons tended to be located in layer Vb, were active spontaneously, and had evidence of somatic inputs, although most required relatively intense stimuli to be excited. Other neurons activated synaptically from the pyramidal tract were located in the layers immediately above and below the pyramidal tract neurons. These cells were divided into two groups on the basis of action-potential latency, action-potential shape, and sensitivity to acetylcholine. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Small lateral suprasylvian cortex lesions produce visual neglect and decreased visual activity in the superior colliculus. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Previous experiments in cats have shown that complete contralateral visual neglect is produced by removing all known visual cortex on one side of the brain, which can then be reversed by damaging the opposite superior colliculus. Presumably, descending facilitatory influences from the visual cortex to the ipsilateral superior colliculus are counterbalanced by intercollicular inhibition (Sprague: Science 153:1544-1546, '66). However, not all of visual cortex or all of the superior colliculus needs to be involved in this circuit. It is the deep rather than the superficial laminae of the superior colliculus that are primarily involved in visual attentive and orientation behaviors, and these laminae are largely independent of primary visual cortex. However, they do depend on corticotectal influences from a comparatively small extraprimary visual area of the posterior region of the lateral suprasylvian cortex (PSSC-Ogasawara et al: J. Neurophysiol. 52:1226-1245, '84). The present experiments demonstrate that lesions only a few millimeters in diameter in this corticotectal zone of the PSSC can produce profound visual neglect. While damage to this area has little, if any, effect on superficial laminae visual activity, it produces a dramatic decrease in the visual activity of the deep laminae. These cats with PSSC lesions fail to orient to a visual stimulus that is introduced suddenly into the contralateral visual field, yet they respond on nearly 100% of the trials to this same stimulus when it is presented in the ipsilateral visual field. The lesion-induced visual neglect produced by PSSC lesions is long-lasting but can be abruptly ameliorated by a midbrain lesion that primarily involves, or undercuts, the deep laminae of the contralateral superior colliculus. Thus, 1) visual neglect can be produced by depriving the deep laminae of the superior colliculus of visual inputs from the cortex, even when the principal visual cortical regions (17, 18, and 19) and their target structures are intact, and 2) visually guided behavior can be restored by eliminating afferents originating in, or passing through, the deep laminae of the contralateral superior colliculus. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Frontal eye field (FEF) projections to the midbrain and pons were studied in nine macaque monkeys that were used to study FEF projections to the striatum and thalamus (Stanton et al.: J. Comp. Neurol. 271:473-492, '88). Injections of tritiated amino acids or WGA-HRP were made into FEF cortical locations where low-level microstimulation (less than or equal to 50 microA) elicited saccadic eye movements, and anterograde axonal labeling was mapped. The injections were made into the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus from dorsomedial sites where large saccades were evoked (lFEF) to ventrolateral sites where small saccades were evoked (sFEF). The largest terminal fields of FEF fibers were located in the ipsilateral superior colliculus (SC). Projections to SC were topographically organized: lFEF sites projected to intermediate and deep layers of caudal SC, sFEF sites projected to intermediate and superficial layers of rostral SC, and FEF sites between these extremes projected to intermediate locations in SC. Patches of terminal labeling were located ipsilaterally in the lateral mesencephalic reticular formation near the parabigeminal nucleus and the ventrolateral pontine reticular formation. These patches were larger from lFEF injections. Small, dense terminal patches were seen in the ipsilateral pontine gray, mostly along the medial and dorsal borders of these nuclei but occasionally in central and dorsolateral regions. Patches of label like those in the pontine nuclei were located ipsilaterally in the reticularis tegmenti pontis nucleus in lFEF cases and bilaterally in sFEF cases. Small terminal patches were found in the nucleus of Darkschewitsch and dorsal and medial parts of the parvicellular red nucleus in most FEF cases. In the pretectal region, labeled terminal patches were consistently found in the nucleus limitans of the posterior thalamus, but we could not determine if label in the nucleus of the pretectal area and dorsal parts of the nucleus of the posterior commissure marked axon terminals or fibers of passage. We found small, lightly labeled terminal patches in the pontine raphe between the rootlets of the abducens nerve (three cases) or in the adjacent paramedian pontine reticular formation (one case). Omnipauser cells in this region are important in initiating saccades. In one sFEF case, very small patches of label were located in the supragenual nuclei anterior to the abducens nuclei and in the ipsilateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi posterior to the abducens nucleus. Presaccadic burster neurons in the periabducens region are known to fire immediately before horizontal saccades.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Descending excitation and inhibition of spinal cord lamina I projection neurons. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Lamina I cells were recorded in the lumbar dorsal horn of decerebrate rats. Their projecting axons were mainly located in the contralateral dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) in the upper cervical cord. 2. The effect on these cells of short and long trains of stimuli applied to the upper cervical DLF was examined by measuring the ongoing activity of the cells, their response to peripheral stimuli, and the size of their receptive fields. 3. The presence of tonic descending influences from brain stem to spinal cord was investigated by measuring the properties of the lamina I cells before and during block of descending impulses. 4. The results of DLF stimulation and of cord block show that substantial and prolonged excitation affected many cells, whereas some were inhibited for shorter periods of time. 5. The experiments were repeated with stimulation of the DLF caudal to chronic section to eliminate descending fibers. The results suggest that the changes of excitability in intact animals were partly produced by stimulation of descending fibers and partly by the invasion of collaterals activated by the antidromic stimulation of the axons projecting from the lamina I cells. 6. Although long trains of DLF stimuli generally excited lamina I cells, only inhibitions were seen in the deep dorsal horn. Moreover, stimulation rostral to an acute unilateral DLF lesion was without effect on lamina I cells but inhibited deep cells. 7. It is proposed that the lamina I cells might activate brain stem circuits, which in turn influence deep dorsal horn cells. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The corpus callosum is the principal neocortical commissure which transmits lateralized information between the hemispheres. The aim of the present experiment was to study the receptive field (RF) properties of somatosensory callosal fibres in the cat. The callosum was approached under direct visual control and axonic responses were recorded under N2O anaesthesia using tungsten microelectrodes or, mostly, glass micropipettes. RFs representing all the sensory submodalities tested (light touch, medium and deep pressure, joint movement and light pinches) were found to be present in the axons which travelled through the callosum. Rapidly adapting units were more common than slowly adapting ones. The axial and para-axial portions of the body accounted for about three-fifths of all RFs, followed by the head (about one-fifth), with the rest responding to stimulation of the extremities. The medial borders of most of the unilateral RFs situated on the trunk and, to a lesser degree, the head, extended to the mid-line. The results are interpreted in terms of the roles of the corpus callosum in mid-line fusion and interhemispheric transfer. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. We have studied the functional and somatotopic properties of 531 single mechanoreceptive thalamic neurons in humans undergoing stereotactic surgery for the control of movement disorders and pain. The majority of these somatosensory cells had small receptive fields (RFs) and were activated in a reproducible manner by mechanical stimuli applied to the skin or deep tissues. These neurons, which we termed &amp;quot;lemniscal,&amp;quot; could be further classified into those responding to stimulation of cutaneous (76% of lemniscal sensory cells) or deep (24%) structures. 2. The incidence of neurons having cutaneous or mucosal RFs in the perioral region, thumb, and fingers (66%) was much higher than that of neurons having RFs elsewhere on the body. Most of the deep cells were activated by movements of and/or mechanical stimuli delivered to muscles or tendons controlling the elbow, wrist, and fingers. 3. Sequences of cells spanning several millimeters in the parasagittal plane often exhibited overlapping RFs. However, RFs changed markedly for cells separated by the same distances in the mediolateral direction. This suggests that the cutaneous somatotopic representation of each region of the body is organized into relatively thin sheets of cells oriented in the parasagittal plane. 4. By comparing neuronal RFs in different parasagittal planes in thalamus of individual patients we have identified a mediolateral representation of body surface following the sequence from: intraoral structures, face, thumb through fifth finger to palm, with forearm and leg laterally. 5. Along many trajectories in the parasagittal plane the sequence of cells with overlapping RFs was interrupted by another sequence of cells with RFs corresponding to a different body region. The RFs of the intervening sequence characteristically represented body regions known to be located more medially in thalamus (see 3 above). These findings could be explained if the lamellae postulated above were laterally convex. 6. Cells responding to deep stimulation (deep cells) could be further classified into those responding to joint movement (63%), deep pressure (15%), or both (22%). Deep cells were found usually at the anterior-dorsal border and sometimes at the posterior border of the region containing cells responding to cutaneous stimuli. Although there was some overlap in the RFs, deep cells representing wrist were found medial to those representing elbow, and both of these were found medial to cells representing leg.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Frontal eye field as defined by intracortical microstimulation in squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and macaque monkeys. II. Cortical connections. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Physiological (intracortical microstimulation) and anatomical (transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin as shown by tetramethyl benzidine) approaches were combined in the same animals to reveal the locations, extents, and cortical connections of the frontal eye fields (FEF) in squirrel, owl, and macaque monkeys. In some of the same owl and macaque monkeys, intracortical microstimulation was also used to evoke eye movements from dorsomedial frontal cortex (the supplementary motor area). In addition, in all of the owl and squirrel monkeys, intracortical microstimulation was also used to evoke body movements from the premotor and motor cortex situated between the central dimple and the FEF. These microstimulation data were directly compared to the distribution of anterogradely and retrogradely transported label resulting from injections of tracer into the FEF in each monkey. Since the injection sites were limited to the physiologically defined FEF, the demonstrated connections were solely those of the FEF. To aid in the interpretation of areal patterns of connections, the relatively smooth cortex of owl and squirrel monkeys was unfolded, flattened, and cut parallel to the flattened surface. Cortex of macaque monkeys, which has numerous deep sulci, was cut coronally. Reciprocal connections with the ipsilateral frontal lobe were similar in all three species: dorsomedial cortex (supplementary motor area), cortex just rostral (periprincipal prefrontal cortex) to the FEF, and cortex just caudal (premotor cortex) to the FEF. In squirrel and owl monkeys, extensive reciprocal connections were made with cortex throughout the caudal half of the lateral fissure and, to a much lesser extent, cortex around the superior temporal sulcus. In macaque monkeys, only sparse connections were present with cortex of the lateral fissure, but extensive and dense connections were made with cortex throughout the caudal one-third to one-half of the superior temporal sulcus. In addition, very dense reciprocal connections were made with the cortex of the lateral, or inferior, bank of the intraparietal sulcus. Contralateral reciprocal connections in all three species were virtually limited to regions that correspond in location to the FEF and the supplementary motor area. The results of this study reveal connections between the physiologically defined frontal eye field and cortical regions known to participate in higher order visual processing, short-term memory, multimodal, visuomotor, and skeletomotor functions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Spinoreticular (SRT) and spinothalamic (STT) neurons were studied for responses to renal and somatic stimuli in 34 cats that were anesthetized with alpha-chloralose. SRT cells were antidromically activated from the medial medullary reticular formation near the gigantocellular tegmental field contralateral (35 cells), ipsilateral (15 cells), or both contralateral and ipsilateral (11 cells) to the recording site. Collision tests showed that activation from two electrodes resulted from stimulation of separate axonal branches and not from current spread. Twenty STT cells were activated from the spinothalamic tract just medial to the medial geniculate nucleus. SRT cells were located in laminae I, V, VII, and VIII of the T12-L2 segments. Most cells were located in lamina VII. STT cells were found in laminae I, V, and VII. The axons of 12 SRT cells were located in the ventrolateral or ventral quadrants of the upper cervical spinal cord. Antidromic conduction velocities of SRT cells averaged 48.7 +/- 3.7 m/s. No differences in conduction velocity were found between cells projecting to different reticular sites. In addition conduction velocity did not vary with the type of somatic or renal input. Antidromic conduction velocities of STT cells averaged 46.4 +/- 4.7 m/s. Renal nerve stimulation excited 58 and inhibited 3 SRT cells. All 20 STT cells were excited. Thirty SRT cells were excited only by A-delta input, 26 received both A-delta- and C-fiber inputs, and 2 cells received only C-fiber input. Ten STT cells received A-delta input only and 10 received both A-delta- and C-fiber inputs. All cells with renal input also received somatic input. Thirty-six SRT cells (59%) were classified as high threshold, 12 (20%) as wide dynamic range, and 10 (16%) as deep. Ten STT cells were classified as high threshold and 10 as wide dynamic range. Somatic receptive fields of STT cells were usually simple and invariably included the left flank region, although many of the fields extended to the left hindlimb or abdomen. Eighteen of the 20 were restricted to the ipsilateral side. In contrast, somatic receptive fields of SRT cells were primarily bilateral (71%). While all but two receptive fields included the left flank area, most extended to one or both hindlimbs, the abdomen, or the right flank. Inhibitory receptive fields were found for 33% of the SRT cells and 20% of the STT cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Central lateral line pathways were mapped in the thronback ray, Platyrhinoidis triseriata, by analyzing depth profiles of averaged evoked potentials (AEPs), multiunit activity (MUA), and single unit recordings. Neural activity evoked by contra- or ipsilateral posterior lateral line nerve (pLLN) shock is restricted to the tectum mesencephali, the dorsomedial nucleus (DMN) and anterior nucleus (AN) of the mesencephalic nuclear complex, the posterior central thalamic nucleus (PCT), the lateral tuberal nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the deep medial pallium of the telencephalon (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6, 7). Neural responses (AEPs and MUA) recorded in different lateral line areas differ with respect to shape, dynamic response properties, and/or latencies (Figs. 9, 10 and Table 1). Ipsilaterally recorded mesencephalic and diencephalic AEPs are less pronounced and of longer latency than their contralateral counterpart (Fig. 9 and Table 1). In contrast, AEP recorded in the telencephalon show a weak ipsilateral preference. If stimulated with a low amplitude water wave most DMN, AN, and tectal lateral line units respond in the frequency range 6.5 Hz to 200 Hz. Best frequencies (in terms of least displacement) are 75-150 Hz with a peak-to-peak water displacement of 0.04 micron sufficient to evoke a response in the most sensitive units (Fig. 11A, B, C). DMN and AN lateral line units have small excitatory receptive fields (RFs). Anterior, middle, and posterior body surfaces map onto the rostral, middle, and posterior brain surfaces of the contralateral DMN (Fig. 12). Some units recorded in the PCT are bimodal; they respond to a hydrodynamic flow field--generated with a ruler approaching the fish--only if the light is on and the eye facing the ruler is left uncovered (Fig. 13). </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Thermal clamping of deep-body temperature and 16 fields covering the total truncal skin surface enabled characterization of thermal transmission neurons distributed in a midline medullary location. The total data set comprised 136 neurons from 54 female rats. Relative abundance of neuronal types was 27 to 34 to 75 for cold-responsive, warm-responsive, and thermally unresponsive neurons. Response maxima of thermoresponsive neurons to static thermal stimulation of the total truncal surface were 55 +/- 4 ips (mean +/- SE) at 5 degrees C for cold-responsive neurons and 6.0 +/- 1.6 ips at 35 degrees C for warm-responsive neurons. Dynamic thermal stimulation of the total truncal surface at rates up to +/- 1.6 degrees C/s failed to reveal a clear dynamic thermosensitivity in either cold- or warm-responsive neuronal pools. Instead, the data suggest a preferential passing of the static response relative to the dynamic response. Cutaneous thermal receptive fields were diffuse, occupying most of the truncal surface. Subparts of these fields drove thermoresponsive neurons to variable extents, suggesting convergence from unequally represented multiple cutaneous sources. Noxious stimulation at widely distributed body sites consistently augmented activity in cold-responsive neurons. A thermoregulatory rather than somatesthetic role is proposed for the midline medullary neurons studied here. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The corpus callosum is the principal neocortical commissure which transmits lateralized information between the hemispheres. The aim of the present experiment was to study the receptive field properties of somatosensory callosal fibres in rhesus macaque monkeys. The callosum was approached under direct visual control and axonic responses were recorded using tungsten microelectrodes. All sensory submodalities which could be examined with the available instruments were found (light touch, medium and deep pressure, joint movement and light pinches). Most fibres had receptive fields concerned with the trunk, followed by the head, with only a few responding to stimulation of the extremities. The medial borders of the unilateral receptive fields situated on the trunk and the head extended to the midline. The results are interpreted in terms of the roles of the corpus callosum in midline fusion and interhemispheric transfer. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Extracellular single-unit recordings were made from auditory neurons in the superior colliculus of ferrets anesthetized with either a neuroleptic or a combination of barbiturate with paralysis. The response properties of these neurons were studied using white-noise bursts presented under free-field conditions in an anechoic chamber. Auditory neurons were found throughout the intermediate and deep layers of the superior colliculus. All neurons were spontaneously active, the rates of discharge varying from 0.1 to 61.1 spikes X s-1. Although the spontaneous discharge interspike-interval histograms for many units approximated to exponential distributions, the histograms of 44% had clear secondary peaks, indicating more than one preferred interval, and could not be modeled by a simple process. Most neurons (50%) responded only at stimulus onset, whereas 12% exhibited sustained discharges and 38% gave onset responses followed by a period of silence or reduced activity and then a period of elevated discharge, which was not apparently related to stimulus offset. Neurons with multipeaked response patterns were concentrated in the stratum griseum profundum. The latencies from arrival of the stimulus at the ear to the onset of neural activity ranged from 6 to 49 ms and decreased with increasing stimulus intensity. Although responsive to sounds over a large region of space, most neurons had clearly defined best positions at which the strongest response was obtained. The response declined as the speaker was moved away from this position, and nearly all units had peaked response profiles. The spatial tuning varied between different neurons, but most were more sharply tuned in elevation than in azimuth. Increasing the stimulus intensity did not, in general, alter the best positions of these neurons, but usually resulted in a broadening of the receptive fields, although other units became more sharply tuned. The best positions of auditory neurons varied systematically in azimuth from 20 degrees into the ipsilateral hemifield to 130 degrees into the contralateral hemifield as the electrode was moved from the rostrolateral to the caudomedial end of the superior colliculus. The best positions shifted in elevation along a rostromedial to caudolateral axis from 60 degrees above to 50 degrees below the visuoaural plane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

The basic principles of magnetic stimulation are described, and the technique is compared with conventional electrical stimulation. Safety aspects are discussed with reference to established clinical electrical and magnetic procedures. The results of the first clinical study using magnetic stimulation are described and show clear central motor pathway slowing in multiple sclerosis patients. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Responses were recorded from 160 ascending tract cells in segments L4 to L6 of the spinal cord in chloralose anaesthetized, spinalized cats. The tract cells were identified by antidromic activation following stimulation of pathways in the lateral and ventral funiculi at the level of the spinal cord transection at the thoracolumbar junction. Axonal conduction velocities ranged from 9 to 114 m/s. A sample of 152 of the neurones examined could be subdivided according to the distribution of their receptive fields into 49 cells activated just from receptors located in skin (&amp;quot;s&amp;quot; cells), 17 neurones excited by receptors in deep tissues (&amp;quot;d&amp;quot; cells), 15 units with a convergent input from receptors in skin and deep tissues (&amp;quot;sd&amp;quot; cells), and 25 neurones with a convergent input from the knee joint and either skin (&amp;quot;sj&amp;quot; cells), deep tissues (&amp;quot;dj&amp;quot; cells) or both (&amp;quot;sdj&amp;quot; cells). No receptive fields could be demonstrated for the remaining 46 neurones. &amp;quot;S&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;sj&amp;quot; cells were found almost exclusively in the dorsal horn, whereas many &amp;quot;d&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sd&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;sdj&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;dj&amp;quot; units were in the ventral horn. Almost all of the cells that lacked receptive fields were in the ventral horn or intermediate grey. Ninety-one of 158 cells (56%) demonstrated no background activity. Of these, 43 cells (27%) lacked receptive fields. Many of the silent neurones were in the ventral horn, but some were in the dorsal horn. Of 25 cells having knee joint input, 18 (72%) had background activity. All of the neurones that had a receptive field in the knee joint also had a convergent input from receptors in other tissues. In 3 cases, there was a receptive field in the skin over the foot (&amp;quot;sj&amp;quot; cells). For 16 cells, receptive fields included not only the knee joint but also skin and deep tissue (&amp;quot;sdj&amp;quot; cells). Usually, the cutaneous receptive field was near the knee joint, but sometimes it was remote, such as on the foot. The deep receptive fields were chiefly in the muscles of the thigh and/or leg. For 6 &amp;quot;dj&amp;quot; cells, the receptive fields included not only the knee joint but also deep fields like those of &amp;quot;sdj&amp;quot; cells. Cutaneous receptive fields were classified as &amp;quot;low threshold&amp;quot; (cells excited best by innocuous intensities of mechanical stimulation), &amp;quot;wide dynamic range&amp;quot; (cells activated by weak mechanical stimuli, but the best responses were to noxious stimuli) or high threshold (innocuous stimuli had little effect, but noxious mechanical stimuli produced a vigorous discharge).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The present study examines the projection to the cerebellar nuclei of Purkinje cells in particular sagittal zones within the intermediate region of the cerebellar cortex. The boundaries between the zones were delimited electrophysiologically on the basis of their climbing fibre input so that a small volume (10-120 nl) of 3H-leucine could be injected into the centre of a chosen zone. The subsequent uptake and orthograde transport of labelled material by the Purkinje cells was studied autoradiographically. It was found that the smallest injections resulted in injection sites restricted to a single cortical zone and extremely reproducible results could be obtained using such a combined electrophysiological/autoradiographic technique. Larger injections sometimes spread to a neighbouring zone but the resultant terminal labelling within the deep nuclei was invariably consistent with the results obtained from smaller injections. The c1 and c3 olivocerebellar zones, which are known to receive climbing fibre input transmitted from the ipsilateral forelimb via a dorsal funiculus spino-olivo-cerebellar pathway (DF-SOCP), were found to project to partially overlapping regions within nucleus interpositus anterior (NIA). No projection to nucleus interpositus posterior (NIP) was demonstrated for either zone. No distinction could be seen between the terminal fields for the medial and lateral halves of the c1 zone which are, however, known to receive their climbing fibre input from quite separate regions within the inferior olive. The c2 zone, which was delimited on the basis of its climbing fibre input which is transmitted from both forelimbs via a lateral funiculus SOCP, was found to project exclusively to interpositus posterior. The hemispheral d1 zone was found to project to the transitional region where interpositus anterior and the dentate nucleus adjoin. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Standard single-unit recording and stimulation techniques were used to assess the topographic organization, receptive field properties, and projections of cells (n = 297) in the ophthalmic-maxillary part of the trigeminal ganglion in 6 normal adult rats and 15 adults with unilateral infraorbital nerve section at birth (cells recorded ipsilateral to lesion: n = 641; cells recorded on the intact side: n = 223). Stimulating electrodes were placed on the central portion of the regenerate infraorbital nerve and in the trigeminal brain stem subnucleus caudalis in 6 nerve-damaged rats and at equivalent points in 5 normal animals. Data from the normal rats and the intact side of the nerve-damaged animals were identical and were considered together. Of these cells, 73.5% had infraorbital receptive fields. Of these, 77.2% were discharged by vibrissa stimulation (43.8% slow-adapt type I, 10.3% slow-adapt type II, 27.6% low-velocity sensitive rapid adapt, 16.8% high-velocity sensitive rapid adapt, and 1.5% noxious-biased), while the rest responded best to guard hair deflection (12.0%), gentle skin indentation (4.5%), or a strong pinch or deep pressure (6.3%). In stereotaxically matched penetrations in ganglia ipsilateral to the neonatal infraorbital nerve lesions, only 40.6% of the cells had infraorbital receptive fields. Of these, only 37.7% responded to vibrissa stimulation (29.8% slow-adapt type I, 1.2% slow-adapt type II, 2.2% low-velocity sensitive rapid adapt, 32.9% high-velocity sensitive rapid adapt, 33.9% noxious). Other infraorbital cells responded best to guard hair deflection (11.9%), gentle skin indentation (10.8%), or a strong pinch or deep pressure (39.6%). An additional 30 cells did not have a detectable receptive field and were identified only by infraorbital and brain-stem shocks. We also recorded cells with unusual infraorbital receptive fields: 9 units responded to more than 1 vibrissa, 4 were activated by both vibrissa and guard hair deflection, 10 had unusually large skin or deep receptive fields, 1 had a split receptive field, and 7 were discharged only by deep pressure to the region of the nerve section. Seven cells with infraorbital receptive fields were not driven by infraorbital shocks, and 2 were not activated by brain-stem shocks. In normal rats, all cells with infraorbital receptive fields were driven by both electrodes. The percentages of receptive field types for noninfraorbital cells were unchanged in ganglia ipsilateral to the damaged nerve.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The auditory response properties of single neurons in the fundus and banks of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES) were studied with simple dichotic stimuli (viz. noise- and tone-bursts) in cats anaesthetized with alpha-chloralose. Neurons within AES showed simple onset responses, were most commonly excited by stimulation of both ears, and showed either broad tuning or multiple high best frequencies. Some neurons were also tested for visual responsiveness and it was found that auditory cells and visual cells were intermingled within the sulcus. A small percentage of cells responded to both auditory and visual stimulation. Overall, the response properties of AES neurons differed from those of nearby auditory cortical fields. The region of AES studied appears to be outside the recently defined fourth somatosensory area (SIV), but overlaps para-SIV found deeper in the sulcus. It appears that deep within the sulcus and along most of its length there is a population of auditory, somatosensory and visual cells; to delineate this auditory population from the surrounding auditory cortical fields this region has been designated Field AES. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Structure-function relationships in rat medullary and cervical dorsal horns. II. Medullary dorsal horn cells. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In Nembutal-anesthetized rats, 31 physiologically identified medullary dorsal horn (MDH) cells were labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). Ten responded only to deflection of one or more vibrissae. Six cells were activated by guard hair movement only, six by deflection of guard hairs or vibrissa(e), and seven by pinch of facial skin with serrated forceps. Different classes of low-threshold cells could not be distinguished on the basis of their somadendritic morphologies or laminar distribution. Neurons activated by multiple vibrissae were unique, however, in that one sent its axon into the medial lemniscus, and three projected into the trigeminal spinal tract. None of the guard hair-only or vibrissae-plus-guard hair neurons had such projections. Cells that responded best to noxious stimulation were located mainly in laminae I, II, and deep V, while neurons activated by vibrissa(e) and/or guard hair deflection were located in layers III, IV, and superficial V. Low-threshold neurons generally had fairly thick dendrites with few spines, whereas high-threshold cells tended to have thinner dendrites with numerous spines. Moreover, the dendritic arbors of low-threshold cells were, for the most part, denser than those of the noxious cells. Neurons with mandibular receptive fields were located in the dorsomedial portion of the MDH; cells with ophthalmic fields were found in the ventrolateral MDH, and maxillary cells were interposed. Cells sensitive to deflection of dorsal mystacial vibrissae and/or guard hairs were located ventral to those activated by more ventral hairs. Neurons with rostral receptive fields were found in the rostral MDH, while cells activated by hairs of the caudal mystacial pad, periauricular, and periorbital regions were located in the caudal MDH. Receptive-field types were encountered that have not been reported for trigeminal primary afferent neurons: multiple vibrissae; vibrissae plus guard hairs; and wide dynamic range. The latter two can be explained by the convergence of different primary afferent types onto individual neurons. Our failure to find a significant relationship between dendritic area (in the transverse plane) and the number of vibrissae suggests that primary afferent convergence may not be responsible for the synthesis of the multiple vibrissae receptive field. Excitatory connections between MDH neurons may, therefore, account for multiple vibrissae receptive fields in the MDH. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Tectal neurons of the frog: intracellular recording and labeling with cobalt electrodes. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> With the aid of cobalt-filled intracellular electrodes, responses evoked by electrical and visual stimulation were recorded from tectal neurons. Diffuse light and &amp;quot;edge&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;spot&amp;quot; stimuli were used for visual stimulation; electrical stimuli were delivered by means of bipolar electrodes to the optic tract. The cells were subsequently filled with cobalt for a correlative histological study. The following types of neurons were distinguished: (1) Pear-shaped neurons with restricted and broad dendritic fields occurring in tectal layers 8, 6, 4, and 2. In one group, the dendrites bore beads and small protrusions and the short axon arborized within, or close to, the dendritic arbor. They responded mostly with inhibitory postsynaptic potentials to the various stimulations. This type of neuron was interpreted to be a tectal interneuron. In the second group the dendrites were smooth, the dendritic arbor was large, and the axon could be followed to layer 7 in a few cases. Excitatory activities with frequent spike discharges prevailed in their responses. They were regarded as efferent neurons of the tectum. (2) Large ganglionic neurons showed a greater variation in form than has been described in previous Golgi studies. Their responses to the different stimulations were also very variable. The axons of five neurons could be followed to the dorsal part of the thalamus, to the postoptic commissural system, and to the direct and crossed tectobulbar tract. These axons emitted several collaterals to tectal, pretectal, and tegmental structures. (3) A single stellate neuron was impaled in layer 9. It responded only to electrical stimulation with excitation. (4) Deep bipolar neurons were not mentioned in earlier works. Their somata were found in layer 6; the vertically oriented dendrites arborized in plexiform layers 7, 5, and 3, over a distance of more than 1 mm. These cells were sensitive only to electrical stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Extracellular recordings of 105 neurones in the cat's somatosensory thalamus were obtained with carbon fibre-containing multibarrel micropipettes. The responses of cells to natural stimulation of cutaneous or deep structures were characterized and the responses to electrical stimulation of primary somatosensory cortex were determined. Receptive fields were mapped and the functional properties were examined before and during the microiontophoretic administration of glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and bicuculline methiodide (BMI). Modality and submodality properties of all cells tested apparently remained unchanged qualitatively, despite all pharmacological interventions. BMI lowered the response threshold of a majority of the 48 cells tested for this variable, although almost 25% responded with elevated thresholds. BMI changed the temporal properties of the responses of both thalamocortical relay neurones and of presumed interneurones. Discharges evoked by natural stimuli and by electrical stimulation of the cortex were prolonged and their pattern was altered. Decreases in the frequency of bursts of discharges were often observed with BMI, and these bursts were invariably prolonged and the interspike interval profiles were altered. Receptive field size changes were observed only in 8 of 48 neurones. For two of these, the field size decreased, while for the others there were small increases. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Laminar differences in sizes, shapes, and response profiles of cutaneous receptive fields in the rat SI cortex. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Quantitative techniques were used to demonstrate cortical layer differences in cutaneous receptive fields (RF's) in the rat SI cortex. Two- and three-dimensional (2-D and 3-D) RF maps were constructed showing the responsiveness of single neurons to standardized punctate stimulation of each of a matrix of points on the skin or the mystacial vibrissa pad. These allowed a visualization not only of the overall sizes of such RF's, but also their shape and &amp;quot;response profile&amp;quot;. Initial experiments showed that the sizes and response profiles of such RF's were similar whether they were mapped by sinusoidal mechanical vibration of skin, punctate touch, or direct intracutaneous electrical stimulation. This method was used to quantitatively determine distoproximal lengths of RF's of single units recorded at different depths in the forepaw area of the SI cortex. Plots of these RF lengths as a function of cortical depth showed that the smallest RF's were found in the granular layers (IV and deep III). RF's up to double that size were found in supragranular layers, and up to triple that size in infragranular layers. 3-D maps of RF's in the granular layers showed sharp central response peaks surrounded by very steep dropoffs to the RF boundaries. In the whisker areas, granular layer RF's were typically circular in shape and contained from 1-4 whiskers. By contrast, in supragranular layers they were often elongated in shape, and were oriented along rows or columns of whiskers. RF's in layer V resembled large, high plateaus, often supporting clearly separated peaks. RF's mapped in the fore- and hindpaw areas were similar, but, even in the granular layers, were often slightly elongated along the limb axis. In all regions of the SI, both the locations and shapes of the granular layer RF's appeared to be conserved as subsets of other more topographically heterogeneous RF's encountered elsewhere in the column. These findings may correlate with patterns of axonal connectivity in the rat SI. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> In rats, as in other mammals, one of the principal projections of the superior colliculus (SC) crosses the midline in the dorsal tegmental decussation to join the contralateral predorsal bundle (PDB). The cells of origin of this pathway were studied by injections of retrograde tracers (true blue or wheatgerm agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase) into the PDB rostral to its major fields of termination. Labelled cells were plotted with respect to fibre layers within the SC. The majority of labelled cells in the contralateral SC were located within the stratum album intermediale (SAI), between the fasciles oriented caudorostrally in that layer. They were of a wide range of sizes, and were much more numerous in lateral SC (where the SAI is broader) than in medial SC. The remaining labelled cells were found mainly in the deep layers. The effects of midline knife-cuts made prior to the injection of tracer suggested that most of the labelled SAI cells, but few of the deep-layer cells, projected across the midline in the dorsal tegmental decussation. Double-labelling procedures were used to investigate whether the cells of origin of the PDB send collaterals in the ipsilateral descending pathway of the SC. Injections of diamidino-yellow into the terminal regions of this pathway labelled very few PDB cells, although large numbers of other tectal cells were labelled. In contrast, extensive double labelling was observed after control injections of diamidino-yellow into the ipsilateral ascending pathway in the ventral diencephalon. These findings suggest that there is anatomical, and therefore perhaps functional, segregation of descending output channels from the superior colliculus in rat. This suggestion receives some support from comparison of the present results with those of tectal stimulation studies. Stimulation in the vicinity of lateral SAI gives contralaterally-directed head and body movements characteristic of orienting and approach, whereas stimulation in other tectal regions that contain predominantly the cells of origin of the ipsilateral descending pathway can give movements resembling avoidance or escape.&lt;/AbstractText&gt;: In rats, as in other mammals, one of the principal projections of the superior colliculus (SC) crosses the midline in the dorsal tegmental decussation to join the contralateral predorsal bundle (PDB).

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The so-called Vertex Potential (VP) of human scalp-conducted and event related brain potential (ERBP), which occur as a slow and often large, biphasic sinusoid within the 100-400 msec time segment after transient stimulation in the three main sensory modalities, are the longest researched of all human evoked potential (EP) phenomena. Its variable amplitude has been directly correlated, in experiments expressly tailored for the purpose, with input/output variables such as the rate of acceleration of given stimulus parameters from a state of relative rest (RM function), interstimulus interval (ISI), stimulus intensity, skin potential and resistance changes (SPR and SRR), the peripheral electroneurogram (ENG), and experimentally isolated C-fiber afference; and with neuropsychological variables such as attention or vigilance, visual acuity, response time, subjective stimulus probability or expectancy, acute pain of both fast and slow kinds, intelligence quotient (IQ), and psychometric personality scores (e.g., extraversion versus introversion and neuroticism versus normality). Unfortunately, the cerebral, neural origins of the VP, if any, are unknown; it is reported as usually absent from cortex-surface EP in those primates and mammals hitherto studied, and also from human extracranial event related magnetic fields of the brain (ERMFb) insofar as these reveal only superficial tangential sources; but a possible analog has been recorded from deep subcortical electrodes during human neurosurgery. In view of the increasing published range and quantity of direct correlates of VP amplitude, and of the scarcity of data about its neuroanatomy and neurophysiology, it seemed a good idea to do some rudimentary signal analysis. Preliminary results from five subjects confirm earlier data: The VP of somatosensory (SEP) and auditory (AEP) evoked potentials, as obtained by scalp-conductance and either averaged or single-epoch, can be resolved into inconsistently stimulus synchronized frequency components which are also present as relatively unsynchronized waves in the theta and alpha bands (approx. 2-13 Hz) of the unstimulated or near-threshold-stimulated electroencephalogram (EEG). In averages of numerous single trials (20 less than N less than 102), initiated at interstimulus intervals longer than 2.5 sec and deliberately sequenced so that the initiator could learn to estimate the timing of stimulus onsets, the phase coherence of the power-dominant alpha and theta waves within the 100-400 msec time segment of ERBP is obvious when the stimulus is an intense transient and psychologically not &amp;quot;habituated&amp;quot;.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The technique of percutaneous microneurography was used to record single unit activity from 75 regenerated primary afferents innervating the glabrous skin of the human hand. Thirteen patients were studied, who had suffered complete transection, with subsequent suture or graft, of the median or ulnar nerves. The recordings were obtained from 7 to 23 months postoperatively (early regeneration). Three types of mechanoreceptive afferents (RA, SAI, SAII) and many deep units of unknown origin were found. No regenerated PC units could be identified. The reinnervated receptors were predominantly located in the palm and proximal fingers, comparable to those found 3 years or more postoperatively (late regeneration). Response thresholds and in general, discharge and receptive field characteristics of the majority of afferents were largely comparable to late regeneration and normal. The properties of SAII units were like normal in all respects. However, several distinct abnormalities were encountered early during regeneration: multiple receptive fields innervated by a single afferent (2/9 RA and 2/9 SAI), unusually small or large receptive fields (RA and SAI), pronounced fatigue on repetitive stimulation (7/15 SAI, 4/6 deep). Responses of reinnervated skin to sustained and repeated indentations were found to be similar to those of normal skin, and therefore, could not account for the abnormal discharge behavior. It is suggested that the transitional properties of regenerating afferents reflect unstable axon-end organ connections and immature axonal properties. Both factors would contribute to the slow course of sensory recovery, making prognosis on tactile recovery unpredictable. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Single neurons in the basal forebrain (nucleus basalis area) were antidromically activated from the frontal or parietal cortex in anesthetized rats. Wide ranges of antidromic latencies were observed overall, with frontal and parietal stimulation yielding values ranging from 1.0 to 26.0 ms and 1.6-24.0 ms, respectively. Individual neurons often exhibited multiple antidromic latencies, such that deeper sites of stimulation or greater stimulation amplitudes generally yielded discretely different, shorter latencies than more superficial sites or lower amplitudes of stimulation. Single neurons were also often driven from neighboring sites (1-2 mm apart) within the frontal cortex, but no cell was coactivated from both frontal and parietal cortices. Finally, patterns and rates of spontaneous activity varied markedly among these cortically projecting neurons, with some cells being non-spontaneous and others exhibiting tonic rates of 30-40 Hz. Impulse waveforms also differed among driven cells, from relatively low-amplitude, negative spikes to large-amplitude, entirely positive spikes in unfiltered signals. These results indicate that cortically projecting, putatively cholinergic neurons in the basal fore-brain form a physiologically heterogeneous population in terms of impulse conduction velocity, spontaneous discharge, and spike waveforms. Our finding of multiple antidromic latencies and driving from neighboring sites indicate that these fibers may be highly branched in local terminal fields, but that individual cells may project exclusively to a single cortical area. Faster conduction velocities for deep compared to superficial cortical stimulation sites imply that these fibers may become non-myelinated upon entering cortical terminal fields, or that they may become markedly thinner as they travel within the cortex. This system of cholinergic cortical afferents differs in many physiologic aspects from the other non-thalamic cortical input systems of catecholamine or indoleamine neurons. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electrophysiological responses of 519 single and 405 multiple neurons located in the distal forelimb zone of the second somatic sensory cortex (SII) of 11 intact cats were characterized according to their submodality and receptive field properties. In 4 of these animals, 46 single and 134 multiple neuronal responses were studied after transection of the dorsal columns contralateral to the cortical recording sites. Receptive field positions overlapped considerably in SII during orthogonal electrode penetrations, but were shifted during tangential penetrations. Analysis of the receptive field positions for neurons encountered in tangential penetrations indicated that receptive fields rarely overlapped when the neurons were separated by more than 750 microns. Using a variety of hand-held stimuli, neuronal responses were assessed according to several criteria including: velocity, adaptation, following rate, spontaneous activity, and whether the response was elicited by stimulating hairs, skin, claws, or deep tissue. Based on these parameters, it was possible to discern several types of neuronal responses in SII. Among these, over 60% of the neurons in our sample responded best to movement of hairs. A smaller number of neurons responded as though they received inputs from Pacinian receptors or rapidly adapting receptors in the glabrous skin. In about 20% of the single neuron sample, it was not possible to identify a selective adequate stimulus, however, these cells responded to somatic stimuli, such as taps. Approximately 5% of the neurons could not be driven with somatic sensory stimuli. Following dorsal column lesions, some neurons in SII still responded to cutaneous stimulation, primarily hair movement. Most SII neurons were more difficult to drive, the responses were more sluggish and receptive fields were less well-defined. A greater proportion of single neuron responses (greater than 60%) could not be activated by any type of somatic sensory stimulus. These results indicate that the dorsal columns provide a potent, but not exclusive, source of afferent input to SII. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Recent studies of the albino rat revealed extensive cutaneous somatosensory projections to the granule cell (GC) layer of the cerebellar hemispheres and the caudal vermis. These projections are organized asomatotopically in patchy mosaics. To determine whether similar projections exist in a marsupial, we explored the GC layer of the cerebellar cortex of anesthetized Virginia opossums using in-depth microelectrode micromapping and juxtathreshold cutaneous natural stimulation techniques. We found: Somatosensory projections to the GC layer exist throughout the mediolateral extent of the folia of the posterior lobe. The anterior lobe was not explored. The submodality of most receptive fields was 'gentle-touch' cutaneous, but some were located in muscle, joint, or other deep-lying structures. Peripheral projections to the GC layer are organized asomatotopically. Adjacent body parts project disjunctively to nonadjacent GC regions, and the overall pattern of peripheral projections forms a patchy columnar mosaic. Many body parts send projections to multiple loci. Ipsilateral projections predominate. Mechanoreceptors from face, snout, mouth and teeth activate the bulk of GC loci on crus I and crus II. The paramedian lobule receives projections from the entire ipsilateral body; the pyramis is activated from hindlimb and forelimb; the uvula from the upper arm and vibrissae. Different folia have different combinations and arrangements of disjunctive patchy peripheral projections. Individual differences in pattern of foliation and body representation occur. Except for differences in mosaic pattern and relative size of different projections, these findings are similar to those in rats and cats. These data suggest that somatosensory (especially cutaneous) inputs to the cerebellum are not only functionally significant, but that they exist widely among mammals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Functional role of GABA in cat primary somatosensory cortex: shaping receptive fields of cortical neurons. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Extracellular recordings of 209 neurons were obtained with carbon fiber-containing multibarrel micropipettes. The cells were isolated in the primary somatosensory cortex of cats anesthetized with barbiturate and classified according to the nature of their response to natural stimuli, the nature of the surrounding multiunit responses to the same stimuli, the response to thalamic stimulation, and their depth in the cortex. To study factors controlling the excitability of somatosensory neurons, their receptive fields were examined in the presence of iontophoretically administered gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, and bicuculline methiodide (BMI). Even when the neurons were depolarized to perithreshold levels with glutamate, or when local inhibitory influences mediated by GABA were antagonized by BMI, the apparent specificity for one class of afferent input was maintained. Neurons responding to stimulation of either cutaneous or deep receptors maintained their modality specificity, and neurons in cutaneous rapidly adapting regions never took on slowly adapting properties. When ejected at currents that did not elicit action potentials, glutamate lowered the threshold for activation by cutaneous stimuli but did not enlarge the receptive field. With larger ejecting currents, the neurons developed an on-going discharge, but even at these higher doses, glutamate did not produce an increase in the receptive-field size. Some neurons in regions of cortex exhibiting slowly adapting multiunit responses were relatively insensitive to glutamate. These cells required four to five times more glutamate to evoke discharges than did most neurons. Other cells, previously unresponsive to somatic stimuli, could be shown to possess distinct cutaneous receptive fields when either glutamate or BMI was ejected in their vicinity. Iontophoretically administered BMI altered the firing pattern of somatosensory neurons, causing them to discharge in bursts of 3-15 impulses. BMI enlarged the receptive-field size of neurons in regions displaying rapidly adapting multiunit background discharges but not in those regions with slowly adapting multiunit discharges. This differential effect of BMI, suggesting that GABA controls receptive-field size in rapidly adapting regions, also indicates that neurons in rapidly adapting regions differ pharmacologically from those in other submodality regions. In all cortical regions, BMI blocked the poststimulus inhibitory period that normally followed thalamic stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS) </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> We have examined the intermediate and deep layers of the cat's superior colliculus for evidence of a neural representation of auditory space. We measured the responses of single units to sounds presented in a free field. The results support the following generalizations. Most auditory units in the superior colliculus have sharply delimited receptive fields which form two discrete classes distinguished by their locations and sizes. The remaining units respond to sounds presented at any location. Each auditory unit responds maximally to sounds at a particular horizontal and vertical location within its receptive field, the unit's &amp;quot;best area.&amp;quot; The best areas and receptive field borders of a unit are resistant to changes in the intensity of stimulus. The locations of best areas shift systematically as a function of unit position to form a continuous map of auditory space. The horizontal dimension of space is mapped rostrocaudally, and the vertical dimension is mapped mediolaterally. This map corresponds in orientation with the map of visual space. These data permit us to infer the distribution of unit activity elicited by a sound at any given location. Regardless of its location, a sound activates a substantial portion of the superior colliculus. Indeed, sounds at some locations activate nearly all of the auditory units. However the activated portion of the colliculus contains a restricted region of units which are excited to near their maximum firing rates. The position of this focus of greatest activity varies systematically according to the location of the sound source, thus mapping the location of the sound in space. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Microwires chronically implanted in the pericruciate cortex of free-to-move cats were used to record extracellularly from cortical neurones and to deliver intracortical stimulation. Natural stimulation of cutaneous and/or deep mechanoreceptors in limbs and trunk evoked discharges in 89% of 165 neurones, 57% of which were pyramidal tract neurones. Out of 112 cells with receptive fields on the contralateral forelimb, 41% had cutaneous fields, 29% had fields involving deep tissues and 30% were driven from both sources. Cutaneous receptive fields were much commoner than deep ones among cells with fields including the forefoot; this relationship was reversed for cells with more proximal fields. Many more cells had distal than proximal fields. The 'zones' of the forelimb (i.e. foot, wrist, elbow, shoulder) provided input to widespread and overlapping cell populations within the coronal gyrus and the lateral parts of the anterior and posterior sigmoid gyri. Despite the overlap a somatotopy existed with successively more distal limb zones represented successively further laterally in the pericruciate area. Intracortical stimulation (eleven cathodal pulses, duration 0.2 ms, frequency 330 Hz, intensity 35 microA or less) evoked flick movements of the contralateral limbs which were abolished by pyramidectomy. In the forelimb, shoulder movements were commonest and elbow, wrist and digits were represented with decreasing frequency. Both for 35 microA and for threshold stimulation the distributions of the effective electrodes revealed an overlapping somatotopy such that the wrist movements were almost restricted to the coronal gyrus and shoulder movements were most often evoked from the lateral part of the anterior sigmoid gyrus. The movement and receptive field somatotopies overlapped heavily but the former showed a distinct lateral shift relative to the latter. As a result shoulder movements were not uncommonly evoked from the coronal gyrus although the shoulder provided almost no input to cells in that area. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Topographic organization of somatosensory corticotectal influences in cat. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Using electrophysiological techniques, the present study demonstrated that substantial direct somatosensory cortical influences on the superior colliculus (SC) originate from three areas: a) SIV, b) para-SIV (the cortex adjacent to SIV but deeper in the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES) and for which no topography has yet been described), and c) the rostral suprasylvian sulcus. Influences also appeared to originate from SI and SII, but these may have been indirect. Detailed examination of the AES revealed that these corticotectal projections are topographically organized, and stimulation of a given cortical locus was observed to affect only those cells in the SC whose receptive fields overlapped those of cells at the stimulation site. A similar receptive-field register was found between the suprasylvian sulcus and the SC. Within this topographic pattern, considerable convergence was evident and an individual SC cell could be influenced from a surprisingly large cortical area. This was particularly evident within the representation of the forelimb. Thus, an SC cell with a receptive field covering the forelimb and paw could receive convergent input from many cortical cells with receptive fields covering all or restricted portions of this body region. Considerable corticotectal divergence also was observed within this general topographic scheme. For example, a given corticotectal site representing the digits sent projections to many different SC cells that included the digits within their receptive fields. These data are more consistent with a block-to-block than a point-to-point corticotectal projection. Somatosensory corticotectal projections excited only those SC cells that could also be activated by peripheral somatosensory stimuli. Similarly, the caudal AES, which contains auditory cells, excited only those SC cells activated also by peripheral auditory stimuli. Yet convergent influences from both auditory and somatosensory regions of the AES were observed in the SC cells that could be activated by both auditory and somatosensory stimuli. These data indicate that the AES is a major source of excitatory input to cells of the deep laminae of the SC. Since it is these deep laminae cells that project to premotor regions of the brain stem and the spinal cord, it is reasonable to suppose that the AES has a significant impact on the output signals of the SC that initiate the orientation responses to peripheral sensory stimulation. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The topographic organization of the climbing fiber (CF) responses was mapped in the rostral vermal cortex (lobules III, IV, and Va) of the cerebellum. Extracellular, single-unit recordings were obtained from 699 Purkinje cells in cats anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. Approximately 72% of the CF responses were elicited by low-threshold or deep tactile stimulation, whereas the remaining units were unresponsive to any peripheral stimulation. On the basis of response characteristics, the vermal cortex was separated into an approximately 1-mm-wide medial zone and a 1 to 1.5-mm-wide lateral zone. The medial zone contained many unresponsive cells, except along the midline, where about 35% of the CF responses were elicited by deep stimulation at the base of the tail. The majority (78%) of the CF responses within the lateral vermal cortex represented various areas of the hindpaw, although representations of the forepaw (8%), tail (4%), and chin (0.6%), as well as unresponsive units (10%), were evident. The lateral vermal cortex contained a mediolateral topography of different receptive fields, although the topography was not sharply defined or equally displayed in all animals. The medial part of the lateral zone contained a representation of the ipsilateral forelimb in lobules IV and Va; the middle part had a representation of the medial or the lateral half of the hindpaw; and the lateral portion of the zone had an extensive representation of the distal hindpaw. The CF responses with similar receptive fields were often found in patches, which in some areas were arranged in layers from the inner to the outer areas of the sublobules. A particular body surface may be represented in multiple patches and in different lobules. Activation of the majority of CF responses within a sublobule may occur only during selected behaviors. </td>

Neither type had collateral axons in VB but each gave branches to the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN). Small putative interneurons in VB and RTN neurons with somatosensory receptive fields were also injected. The RTN neurons had profusely branched widely ramifying axons in VB and adjoining nuclei. Injected medial lemniscal axons in VB had a range of receptive field properties and conduction velocities and ended in elongated anteroposterior domains with one or more dense concentrations of terminal boutons of varying size and with varying numbers of boutons. </td>

This drug produced an enlargement of the receptive field areas of 14 of 18 cells situated in regions expressing rapidly adapting submodality backgrounds. However, this action of the GABA antagonist was noted only in 4 of 18 cells located within cortical regions characterized by slowly adapting or deep backgrounds. Glutamate and GABA did not alter receptive field size, although these amino acids did change the threshold and magnitude of the response to tactile stimulation. No change in modality or submodality properties of any neuron was observed with any of the compounds tested. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The distribution and organization of mechanosensory projections to the cuneate, gracile and external cuneate nuclei were mapped in tree squirrels anesthetized with ketamine and urethane. Tungsten microelectrodes were used to record unit and unit cluster responses to mechanical stimulation. Most responses in the gracile nucleus were to stimulation of skin and hairs of the tail, hind foot and leg, and trunk, in that order going from dorsal to ventral in the nucleus. A similar distribution of responses was found in the cuneate nucleus to stimulation of forelimb, neck and pinna going from dorsomedial to ventrolateral in the nucleus. Some responses to stimulation or movement of subcutaneous tissue were found in the cuneate and gracile nuclei. Responses in the external cuneate were to stimulation of deep-lying tissues in the hand medially, the lower arm centrally and the shoulder and trunk laterally. The pattern of projections in the tree squirrel differed most strikingly from that seen in raccoons and opossums in the relatively small extent of projections from the glabrous skin of the forepaws which were concentrated in a small region near the obex in squirrels. In contrast, there was a large representation of hairy receptive fields located on the forelimb in all regions of the squirrel cuneate nucleus. Otherwise, the somatotopic organization of mechanosensory projections to these dorsal column nuclei in tree squirrels was similar to that reported in other mammals. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Single unit responses to noxious and non-noxious somatic stimulation were investigated in the somatosensory (SmI) cortex of rats under halothane-nitrous oxide anaesthesia. Four categories of neurons were observed: (1) neurons driven by non-noxious cutaneous stimulation, (2) neurons driven by non-noxious deep stimulation, (3) neurons driven by noxious stimulation only (nociceptive specific neurons), (4) neurons driven by noxious as well as non-noxious stimulation (convergent or nociceptive non-specific neurons). The receptive fields of the neurons driven by contralateral cutaneous non-noxious stimulation were small. These neurons responded phasically to cutaneous stimulation in the majority of cases. Neurons driven by stimulation of deep receptors (e.g. joint movement) could also be recorded in the same part of SmI cortex. Neurons driven by noxious stimulation had large receptive fields and were often tonically driven by noxious stimulation. Convergent (or nociceptive non-specific) neurons could often be inhibited from body parts not included in their excitatory receptive field. Some neurons driven by noxious stimulation were able to encode stimulus parameters such as temperature of a hot water bath or surface of the skin area stimulated. The different categories of neurons defined above could be successively recorded during a given electrode penetration. Evidence for the somatotopic organization of the different categories of inputs was obtained. These results strongly suggest that the first somatosensory (SmI) neocortex is involved in nociception. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Single neuronal activity was recorded extracellularly from the Forel's field (FH), subthalamic region immediately rostral to the FH (STRF), rostral end of the medial subthalamic region (RE) and lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) of the anesthetized cats. Many of the FH, RE and LHA neurons were excited by nociceptive stimulation such as pinching the skin with serrated forceps and/or intra-arterial injection of bradykinin. These nociceptive neurons were also excited by non-nociceptive stimulation such as tap of deep tissues, bending hairs with an air-puff and/or joint rotation. On the other hand, inhibition by both nociceptive and non-nociceptive stimuli was seen in and around the rostral end of the FH including STRF. Their receptive fields were large. After intravenous administration of either morphine or pentazocine, most nociceptive neurons became unresponsive to nociceptive stimuli, although they were driven by non-nociceptive stimuli. This suggests that morphine and pentazocine have a specific antinociceptive action on these nociceptive neurons. Intravenous naloxone reversed the antinociceptive action of morphine, but failed to reduce the action of pentazocine. This differentiation has an important functional significance. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Electrophysiological response properties of spinoreticular neurons in the monkey. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Extracellular recordings were made from 29 spinoreticular cells in the spinal cords of anesthetized monkeys. The cells were in either the cervical or the lumbar enlargement, and they were identified by antidromic activation from the medial part of the pontomedullary reticular formation. More spinoreticular neurons were sampled in the cervical than in the lumbar cord. Most of the cells were contralateral to the side from which antidromic activation was observed, but a higher proportion of the spinoreticular neurons in the cervical enlargement than in the lumbar enlargement was ipsilateral to the antidromic stimulus. Three cells in the lumbar cord were antidromically activated not only from the reticular formation but also from the contralateral thalamus, confirming that some spinoreticular projections are formed by collaterals from spinothalamic cells. Most of the spinoreticular neurons were in the ventral horn in laminae VII and VIII, although a few were in laminae IV-VI. Nearly half of the spinoreticular cells in the sample could not be activated by any form of peripheral stimulation tested. The other cells could be activated by stimulation of receptive fields that varied from small to large, that were sometimes bilateral regions of the skin or deep tissues. Although some spinoreticular cells could be classified as low threshold or wide dynamic range, the largest proportion were high threshold, requiring noxious stimulation for their activation. Descending volleys resulting from stimulation in the reticular formation could often be shown to inhibit or to excite spinoreticular neurons. It can be concluded that at least some spinoreticular neurons may play a role in nociception. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The somatotopic organization of somatosensory (SI) cortical projections to the deep layers of the superior colliculus (SC) in rats was examined using neurophysiological micromapping methods. Electrical stimulation of SI produced SC unit responses at the same depths as did peripheral tactile stimulation, in SC laminae IV and VI; mapping of corticotectal projections was performed only in lamina IV. Antidromic activation of the pathway revealed that corticotectal cell bodies are located in SI layer V. Corticotectal projections were found to interconnect only those SI and collicular areas which have similar tactile receptive fields. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Cortico-cortical neurons and pyramidal tract neurons of the cat were tested for convergent inputs from forelimb afferents. Neurons were recorded in cortical areas 1, 2, and 3a. Consideration was given to both suprathreshold and subthreshold inputs evoked by electrical stimulation of forelimb nerves. Individual cortico-cortical neurons and also pyramidal tract neurons were characterized by convergence of multiple somatosensory inputs from different regions of skin, from several muscle groups, and between group I deep afferents and low threshold cutaneous afferents. Certain patterns of afferent input varied with cytoarchitectonic area. There was, however, no difference between area 3a and areas 1-2 in the incidence of cross-modality convergence in the form of input from cutaneous and also deep nerves. Many of the inputs were subthreshold. Arguments are presented that these inputs, though subthreshold, must be considered for a role in cortical information processing. The convergent nature of the sensory inputs is discussed in relation to the proposed specificities of cortical columns. The patterns of afferent inputs reaching cortico-cortical neurons seem to be appropriate for them to have a role in the formation of sensory fields of motor cortex neurons. PT neurons of somatosensory cortex have possible roles as modifiers of ascending sensory systems, however, the convergent input which these PT neurons receive argues against a simple relationship between the modality of peripheral stimuli influencing them and the modality of the ascending tract neurons under their descending control. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Afferent inhibition in several distinct types of cuneate neurons was studied using controlled natural stimuli in 35 lightly anesthetized cats. Mechanoreceptive cuneate neurons were recorded extracellularly with microelectrodes from the middle and caudal divisions of the main nucleus. They were classified into several modality subtypes based on their response to adequate mechanical stimuli. Emphasis was laid on the neurons which had their receptive fields (RFs) in the forepaw. Afferent inhibition was induced by conditioning tactile stimuli in 31 out of 168 neurons (18%) tested. There were particular combinations between the neuron types inhibited and conditioning stimulus modalities. Dynamic stimuli such as high frequency vibration and hair movement by air-jet stimuli applied to areas beyond the excitatory RFs induced inhibition on touch (T), hair (H) and slowly adapting pad (SA) units predominantly in the paw region. In contrast, steady pressure stimulation on the skin adjacent to the excitatory RFs induced inhibition in exclusively slowly adapting neurons receiving afferent inputs from hairy skin such as touch (T), joint (J) and subcutaneous (Deep) units in the paw, elbow and shoulder regions. Most of the inhibitory RFs were organized laterally or eccentrically rather than concentrically around the excitatory RF. Two J units were found to be inhibited by steady pressure applied to the shoulder region of the contralateral forelimb. Functional significance of the intramodality and cross modality inhibition of cuneate neurons is discussed. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Neurons were recorded extracellularly in the mesencephalic reticular formation outside the interstitial nucleus of Cajal in cerebellectomized cats anesthetized with alpha chloralose. Reticulospinal neurones were identified by antidromic stimulation of the upper cervical segments. Stimulation in the deep layers of the ipsilateral superior colliculus evoked firing in 36% of reticulospinal neurons. For many neurons thresholds for activation were high in the intermediate tectal layers and declined as the electrodes entered the underlying tegmentum. However, low threshold points were found above the deep fiber layer within the superior colliculus for some cells. Stimulation of the contralateral superior colliculus excited 10% of neurons and thresholds for activation were high above the deep fiber layer for all neurons. Stimulation of the ipsilateral and contralateral pericruciate cortex excited 39 and 21% of neurons, respectively. The lowest threshold area was found in the frontal eye fields. Sixteen percent of neurons received excitation from neck muscle afferents (C2 biventer-cervicis) bilaterally. Comparison of responses between mesencephalic reticulospinal neurons and interstitiospinal neurons (Fukushima et al. 1981) showed that responses of the two groups of neurons were similar when the pericruciate cortex and neck muscle afferents were stimulated. However, a difference was observed in tectal responses. since low threshold points were rarely observed above the deep fiber layer for interstitiospinal neurons. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Effects of stimulation of frontal cortex, superior colliculus, and neck muscle afferents on interstitiospinal neurons in the cat. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Interstitiospinal neurons were activated by antidromic stimulation of the spinal cord ventromedial funiculus at C1 and C4 in cerebellectomized cats under chloralose anesthesia. Neurons responding only to C1 were classified as N cells and those responding both to C1 and C4 were classified as D cells, as in previous experiments (Fukushima et al. 1980a). Vestibular branching interstitiospinal and reticulospinal neurons were also identified as in the previous experiments. Stimulation of the ipsilateral pericruciate cortex evoked firing in 31% of N cells, 41% of D cells and 35% of the vestibular branching neurons, while stimulation of the contralateral cortex excited 6% of N cells, 29% of D cells and 14% of vestibular branching neurons. Response latencies ranged from 2 to 15 ms after the effective pulse. By measuring the thresholds of activation of these neurons while changing the depth of the stimulating electrodes, and by mapping the cortical areas, it was shown that the lowest threshold areas were in the frontal eye fields and the anterior sigmoid gyrus near the presylvian sulcus (Area 6). Stimulation of the latter area often evoked neck or shoulder muscles contraction. Stimulation in the deep layers of the ipsilateral superior colliculus evoked firing in about 20% of interstitiospinal neurons and about 42% of vestibular branching neurons, with typical latencies 2-3 ms after the effective pulse, while stimulation of the contralateral superior colliculus was rarely effective. N cells and D cells responded similarly. Thresholds for activation were high in the intermediate tectal layers and declined as the electrodes entered the underlying tegmentum. This suggests that the superior colliculus is not the main source of synaptic inputs to these neurons. Low threshold points were found above the deep fiber layer when stimulating electrodes were inserted into the pretectum. Stimulation of the C2 biventer cervicis nerve excited about 8% of N cells, 18% of D cells, and 15% of vestibular branching neurons bilaterally with typical latencies around 10 ms. Similar results were obtained when C2 splenius nerves were stimulated. The fibers responsible for such excitation are probably group II, since stimuli stronger than 1.8 times threshold of the lowest threshold fibers were needed to evoke excitation. Response decrement was often observed when stimuli were repeated at 1/s, while no such decrement was observed at the rate of 1/3 s. When the convergence of cortical and labyrinthine excitatory inputs was studied, 36% of interstitiospinal neurons received single inputs either from the pericruciate cortex or from the labyrinth, 22% of neurons received convergent excitation from both and the remaining 42% did not respond to either stimulus. Although vestibular branching neurons rarely received labyrinthine inputs, they frequently showed convergence of excitation to stimulation of the frontal cortex, superior colliculus and vestibular nuclei. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. Spinoreticular tract neurons at the rat lumbar cord level were identified by antidromic activation following stimulation at mainly pontine and mesencephalic levels. These units, which were found in the dorsal half of the cord, could be separated into two groups according to their spinal location, electrophysiological properties, and their central projections. 2. Units in the dorsolateral funiculus nucleus projected mainly to the cuneiformis area and adjacent structures with frequent bilateral projections. They had the slowest conduction velocities, sometimes in the unmyelinated range. Generally, they were driven only by stimulation of subcutaneous and/or deep structures. 3. Neurons located in the dorsal horn mainly projected contralaterally to pontine and mesencephalic levels. their conduction velocities and the electrophysiological properties were identical to those observed for the rat spinothalamic tract (22). Almost all (86%) had clear cutaneous sensitivity and generally large receptive fields: 40% responded to nonnoxious and noxious mechanical cutaneous stimuli and frequently to noxious radiant heat, 26% were exclusively excited by light tactile stimuli, and 20% required noxious cutaneous mechanical stimulation for activation. There was a good correlation between responses to natural and transcutaneous electrical stimulation: units driven by noxious mechanical stimuli received A-delta- and/or C-fiber inputs. The remaining units (14%) had more complex receptive fields associated with both excitatory and inhibitory inputs originating from a single peripheral area. 4. The functional heterogeneity of the rat spinoreticular tract is reminiscent of that demonstrated for the rat and monkey spinothalamic tracts. Similarly, the rat spinoreticular neurons are under the influence of descending inhibitory controls originating from the nucleus raphe magnus and bulbar reticular formation. 5. Responses of the rat spinoreticular tract neurons are consistent with the involvement of this pathway in the transmission of messages of both innocuous and noxious origins. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Responses of long descending propriospinal neurons to natural and electrical types of stimuli in cat. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> Long descending propriospinal (LDP) neurons (antidromically identified) having cell bodies of origin in the cervical enlargement and projecting axons at least as far as the L2 segment were studied. Extracellular recording of responses to natural and electrical stimuli was done in high-spinal cats. (1) A receptive field for natural stimuli was found for 123 LDP neurons. An additional 108 LDP cells were not activated by the natural stimuli used, but some of these fired spike potentials in response to electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves of the forelimb. There was no distinction between neurons activated and those not activated by natural stimuli on the basis of location or conduction velocity. (2) The most effective natural stimuli were mechanical manipulation of the skin (both low and high threshold), movement of joints of the paw, and pressure to the deep tissues, especially to the extensor side of the arm. These modalities of stimuli were most often excitatory, but could be inhibitory as well. (3) On the basis of modality, 4 subgroups of LDP cells were identified: those which were responsive only to mechanical-cutaneous, joint-movement, or deep-pressure stimuli, and those which responded to several of these modalities of stimuli, the multimodal group. These subgroups could not be distinguished on the basis of conduction velocity. (4) The receptive fields varied in size from small (one digit) to large (all of a forelimb). For single LDP cells they included ones with single and/or multimodal input from one or both forelimbs and various combinations of excitation and/or inhibition. However, those in the dorsal horn had only ipsilateral receptive fields, mainly of the mechanical-cutaneous type. Cells with bilateral receptive fields were mainly located medially in the ventral gray in laminae VII and VIII. (5) A comparison of the location of the subtypes of LDP cells revealed that neurons activated by mechanical-cutaneous stimuli were in laminae I and IV-VIII; whereas deep-pressure and multimodal activated neurons were almost exclusively in laminae VII and VIII. (6) LDP cells receiving input from deep-pressure receptors of the paw probably relay position or weight-bearing information about the forelimbs to the lumbosacral spinal cord. This arrangement suggests that LDP neruons function in interlimb coordination and would be active during locomotion. They probably participate also in other reflexes elicited by cutaneous and deep stimuli. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The organization of the visual projection to the hyperstriatum, or Wulst, in the domestic chick has been investigated using extracellular recording with microelectrodes. The entire visual field of the contralateral eye projects retinotopically into the Wulst. The superior and inferior margins of the visual field are represented, respectively, in the posterior and anterior regions of the visual projection area. The projection of the nasal and temporal margins of the visual field is more complex, the superior and inferior parts of the temporal hemi-field being represented in the superficial and deep regions of the Wulst respectively, with an intervening projection of the nasal hemi-field at an intermediate depth. Visually responsive units appear to be restricted to the accessory hyperstriatum (HA) and possibly also to a narrow, medial region of the intercalated nucleus (HIS). Visual-evoked activity was never detected in the dorsal hyperstriatum (HD) or ventral hyperstriatum (HV). The organization found in the chick is discussed in relation to the previous physiological and anatomical findings of other workers in the visual Wulst of the pigeon and the owl. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 19 visual effects have been elicited out of 9,383 sites during stimulation mapping for physiological localization during stereotactic surgery. It is proposed that three visual pathways can be recognized during subcortical electrical stimulation in man. The optic tract and geniculocalcarine pathway, projecting to area 17, are recognizable by the production of contralateral coloured phosphenes. The tectopulvinar pathway projecting to areas 18 and 19 is recognizable by the eliciting of contralateral or bilateral colourless phosphenes or 'negative' visual effects, the latter presumably reflecting inhibitory collicular influences. Finally, deep responses, consisting of apparent movement of the visual fields, intermingled with 'negative' visual and oculomotor effects, suggest activation of a visual-oculomotor coordinating system. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> One hundred seventy-five neurones in the n.ventroposterior lateralis (VPL) and n.ventralis lateralis (VL) in the thalamus of anaesthetised monkeys have been tested antidromically for projection to the cortex and for somatosensory input from the contralateral arm. Using bipolar stimulation of the cortical surface, 113 thalamic neurones were successfully identified as antidromically driven from the hand area of the postcentral gyrus (48 neurones) or from the hand area of the precentral gyrus (65 neurones). All but one of these 113 neurones could only be antidromically discharged from the postcentral cortex or from the precentral cortex, and not from both. Most had antidromic latencies between 0.5 and 1.5 ms. Twenty-five/sixty-five precentrally projecting neurones and 45/48 postcentrally projecting neurones were activated by stimulation of the contralateral median or radial nerves. Both groups responded at short latency (4--8 ms) and many were activated by low-threshold shocks (0.8--1.3 T) and had restricted receptive fields on the hand. Precentrally projecting neurones responded most powerfully to joint movement or deep pressure, and some of these neurones were also responsive to cutaneous stimuli. Precentrally projecting neurones with peripheral inputs were all found in the oral subdivision of the VPL (the VPLO). The properties of these neurones suggest that they may be partly responsible for rapid somatosensory input to the motor cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Fucntional specialization and binocular interaction in the visual areas of rhesus monkey prestriate cortex. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> If is is believed that neural mechanisms mediating stereoscopic vision may be localized in specific areas of the visual cortex, then it becomes necessary to be able to define these areas adequately. This is no easy matter in the rhesus monkey, an animal close to man, where the cytoarchitecturally uniform prestriate cortex is folded into deep sulci with secondary gyri. One way around this awkward problem is to use the callosal connections of the prestriate cortex as the anatomical landmarks. Callosal connections are restricted to regions at which the vertical meridian is represented. Since the visual fields, including the vertical meridian, are separately represented in each area, each has its own callosal connections. These are of great help in defining some of the boundaries of these areas, since the boundaries often coincide with the representation of the vertical meridian. With the visual areas thus defined anatomically, it becomes relatively easy to assign recordings to particular areas. Studies of binocular interactions in these areas reveal that most cells in all prestriate areas are binocularly driven. Hence, theoretically, all of the prestriate areas are candidates for stereoscopic mechanisms. The degree of binocular interaction varies from cell to cell. At the two extremes are cells which either respond to monocular stimulation only and are inhibited by binocular stimulation or ones which respond to binocular stimulation only. Changing, as opposed to fixed, disparity is signalled by two types of cells. In one category are cells activated in opposite directions for the two eyes. Such cells are always binocularly driven. In the other category are cells, some of which are monocularly activated, that are capable of responding to changing image size. In the monkey, both these categories of cells have so far been found in the motion area of the superior temporal sulcus only. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> The afferents and projections of the ventroposterolateral thalamus in the monkey. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In seven monkeys (M. fascicularis), recordings were made from neurones in subnuclei VPLo and VPLc of the thalamus. The peripheral inputs to these cells from the forelimb were established by stimulating muscle, skin and joint nerves, and cutaneous receptive fields were examined by natural stimulation of the skin. The projection of the same cells to motor and sensory cortex was examined by stimulation of the cortex to demonstrate antidromic responses and by retrograde axonal transport of horseradish peroxidase injected into these regions of cortex. Of the 139 neurones which were driven by stimulation of peripheral nerves, 73 were located in VPLo. This suggests that there is a significant projection of forelimb afferents to VPLo in the monkey. Of the 73 neurones located in VPLo, 60 responsed to stimualtion of muscle or joint nerves. The projection to VPLo is therefore predominantly from deep receptors. Twenty-one of these 73 neurones had convergent inputs. The latencies of activation of units in VPLo were short (4--8 ms) and consistent with a lemniscal pathway via the dorsal column nuclei. Injection of horseradish peroxidase into the arm area of the motor cortex labelled cells in VPLo and not in VPLc. The neurones from which recordings were made in VPLo were located within the population of cells labelled with horseradish peroxidase after injections into the primary motor area. This suggests that this subnucleus is the thalamic relay for the sensory input from peripheral receptors to cells of the motor cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> 1. The superior colliculus projects to the dorsolateral nucleus of the pons. Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) revealed that cells in the superior colliculus, which send their axons to the pons, lie in both superficial (III) and deep (IV--VII) layers. Superficial cells outnumbered deep cells. The inferior colliculus also projects heavily to the dorsolateral pontine nucleus. 2. Dorsolateral pontine visual cells were activated only by visual stimulation. Cells responsive to somatic or auditory stimulation were also found in the dorsolateral nucleus, and they too responded to only one sense modality. 3. Of the dorsolateral pontine visual cells, 69% were directionally selective. 4. Dorsolateral pontine visual cells were responsive to moving targets over a wide range of stimulus velocities. Velocities between 25 and 100 degrees/s were the most effective. No cells responded to a stationary stimulus. 5. Single-spot targets were the most effective stimuli. Stimulus size was a more important parameter than stimulus configuration. Many cells had inhibitory regions outside of their excitatory fields. 6. The excitatory receptive fields of dorsolateral pontine cells were very large (median, 1,100 deg2). 7. Nearly all receptive fields were centered in the contralateral visual hemifield, and 91% of the dorsolateral visual cells were activated from either eye. 8. We conclude that the visual cells in the dorsolateral nucleus have receptive-field properties that are similar to those of cells in the superior colliculus. The preference of dorsolateral cells for single-spot targets contrasts strongly with the multiple-spot preference of medial pontine cells, which receive their input from visual cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The vestibular thalamic relay in the Rhesus ventrobasal complex, identified in a previous field potential study (part I, Deecke et al., 1974), has now been investigated with neuronal recordings in the thalamus in order to clarify its functional role. In part I, short latency responses (2.5 msec) were found in the corner between VPL, VPM and VPI nuclei, largely including dorsal portions of the VPI nucleus. Field potentials of somewhat longer latency (4-5 msec) were recorded in VPL and in other thalamic nuclei, including the posterior nuclear group. Neuronal responses were recorded in thalamic nuclei of awake flaxedilized Rhesus monkeys. Cells not responding to vestibular stimulation (round window polarisation of either labyrinth) were ignored. The great majority (80%) of those neurons responding to labyrinth polarisation showed convergence with deep somatic (proprioceptive) input from joints and muscles of vertebral column and limbs. 60% of these bimodal neurons responded to movement of cervical joints. Very few vestibularly responsive cells received cutaneous (6.6%), non-optokinetic visual or auditory (2.6% each) input. Proprioceptive fields tended to be large, frequently involving more than one joint, and could be even bilateral. For a few cells the pattern of vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence could be fitted to a coordinated body position that might occur during normal locomotion. 78% of the cells responded to polarisation of both labyrinths, indicating strong bilateral projection. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Axons of retinal ganglion cells showed responses not previously emphasized: (a) many tonic units discharged oscillations, 2--12 spikes per burst, interburst intervals 20--300 msec; (b) phasic units showed concentric or flanking ON and OFF fields, response frequency depended on balance of retinal excitation and inhibition; (c) directional sensitivity was maximal for retinal stimuli moving in naso-temporal direction; (d) in anterior tectum deep afferent layer (DAL) provides for deep electrical sink, fibers of DAL have small fields, mostly in front of fish; (e) color-opponent units are prevalent in the superficial terminal layers, color is spatially and temporally represented. Tectal cell responses were distinguished by large visual fields, spontaneity, multiple spikes and long latencies to optic nerve stimulation, failure to follow above 60 per sec, plasticity of response. Tectal neurons of three classes included (a) cells of one type in upper layers were inhibited in ongoing activity by visual input, receptive fields exceeded 100 degrees, were often oblong, responses did not habituate; (b) cells of second type were excited by visual stimuli, became unresponsive (habituated) or responsive only to stimuli in different position or direction (newness cells); lability precluded field mapping and dishabituation was produced by change in background, extraneous stimulation, and spontaneous firing; (c) pyriform cells in periventricular layer were abundant, difficult to isolate electrically, discharged spontaneously in bursts at intervals of several seconds and responded to visual input by interruption of firing. Some tectal cells responded to non-visual stimuli as well. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The existence of descending propriospinal reflex linkages between forelimbs and hindlimbs has been established in the brush-tailed possum (Trichosurus vulpecula). In animals under chloralose anesthesia and with intact brain stem, forelimb volleys evoked facilitation of flexor and extensor monosynaptic reflexes of both hindlimbs, more pronounced on the ipsilateral side. Powerful inhibition of briefer latency and restricted to ipsilateral flexor digitorum longus (FDL) motoneurons was also brought about by forelimb volleys; at latencies exceeding 20-30 ms, FDL inhibition was usually replaced by facilitation. Distinctness of the two long spinal actions was shown by differences in forelimb receptive fields and in threshold of the executant afferent fibers. The field for reflex inhibition was located distally in the forepaw region, that for facilitation being wider, including deep as well as superficial tissues. Threshold of afferent fibers evoking inhibition was lower than that for facilitation. The descending long spinal actions were compared with those set up by repetitive stimulation of the motor cortex contralateral to the test hindlimb reflexes. In agreement with previous work, strong facilitation of most flexor or extensor motoneurons was produced, including those of quadriceps and ankle flexors, as well as gastrocnemius and hamstring motor nuclei; inhibition consistently appeared only in the FDL motoneuron pool. Weak and inconstant inhibitory action was occasionally observed in other motor pools. Pyramidal tract section abolished the cortical inhibition of FDL, but had little effect on facilitation; both long spinal actions were unchanged. Pyramid-sparing brain stem section greatly reduced both cortical and long spinal facilitatory action, but had little or no effect on FDL inhibition from either source. Interaction experiments demonstrated facilitation of weak inhibitory actions on FDL motoneurons of forelimb and cortical stimulation when elicited together, suggesting a sharing by the two inputs of common interneuronal elements. The observation is consistent with the notion that the long propriospinal system responsible for FDL inhibition from the forepaw might provide the pathway for pyramidal inhibition of the same group of motoneurons. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Units recorded from the optic tectum of Gallus domesticus were tested for responses to visual, auditory and somesthetic and stimuli. Units recorded from the superficial tectal layers (stratum opticum, stratum griseum et fibrosum superficiale) responded only to visual stimuli. On the basis of the unit's responsiveness to the directionality of a moving visual stimulus, three unit types referred to as pandirectional, unidirectional, and multidirectional units were identified. In the deeper layers (stratum griseum centrale, stratum album centrale) unimodal and bimodal units were encountered. These units responded to visual, auditory, and/or somesthetic stimuli. These results indicate that the tectal cortex of Gallus domesticus is subdivided into two functional divisions: the superficial layers which correlate visual information and the deep layers which correlate visual and nonvisual information. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> In unanesthetized cats, microstimulation within the red nucleus produces contraction of single muscles of the contralateral limbs and face. Separate zones may activate different muscles. Forelimb muscles were primarily activated from areas in the dorsomedial quadrants of the red nucleus whereas hindlimb muscles were predominantly activated from the ventorlateral quadrants. With stimulus currents of 10 muA there was considerable overlap in the effective zones activating different muscles. In the majority of cases the minimal threshold was under 10 muA when stimilating with a 50-msec pulse train. Current thresholds for electromypgraphic changes in the muscles varied inversely with pulse frequency and train duration. When long stimulus trains were applied to the red nucleus, the resulting muscle contraction was sustained for the duration of the stimulus. These motor effects did not depend upon the motor cortex or pyramidal tract but were mediated by a tract in contralateral dorsal quadrants of the spinal cord which was likely to be the rubrospinal tract. Units within the red nucleus typically had wide cutaneous receptive fields and responded to deep pressure and joint rotation in one or more limbs. Usually the focus driving the cell most briskly was located in one of the contralateral limbs and corresponded to the limb where muscle contraction was elicited by microstimulation with the same electrode. It is concluded that the red nucleus includes overlapping efferent neuronal colonies controlling individual muscles irrespective of their functional class. This property is shared by the motor cortex and suggests that these two structures may complement each other in the control of movement. The more diffuse activation of rubral than cortical neurons by natural stimuli suggests that rubral activity may not be as tightly linked as that of the motor cortex to specific peripheral input. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> Functional significance of projection from the cerebellar nuclei to the motor cortex in the cat. </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The functional organization of projections from the cerebellar subcortical nuclei to the motor cortex through the nucleus ventralis lateralis (VL) of the thalamus was studied using tungsten microelectrodes for stimulation and recordings in acute and chronic cats. The following results were obtained. (1) Microstimulation of a small area of the ventral thalamus produced contraction of a single limb muscle as well as movements of whiskers. (2) The stimulus parameters for producing low threshold contraction of limb muscles were different from those for face muscles. The decrease of the frequency gradualy increased the threshold values for face muscles whereas the decrease abruptly increased the threshold for limb muscles. The optimum duration of the train for the lowest thresholds was longer for face muscles. (3) Stimulation of cerebellar nuclei (interpositus and lateralis) produced contraction of limb muscles. The stimulus parameters for the minimum threshold were similar to those for producing contraction of limb muscles from the ventral thalamus. (4) The peripheral receptive fields of neurons located around the low threshold sites in the thalamus were diffuse, i.e. they were driven insecurely by twisting the joints or pressure to the deep structures, but could not be driven by touch or light pressure on a circumscribed area of the body. (5) Chronic ablation of the motor cortex did not abolish the muscle contractions produced by thalamic stimulation, excluding the possibility that the effects were produced by stimulation of the branches of the pyramidal tract fibers reaching the ventral thalamus. (6) Chronic section of the brachium conjunctivum abolished or changed the characteristics of the contractions produced by thalamic stimulation indicating that the previous effects were produced by stimulation of cerebellar efferent fibers reaching the thalamus. (7) From these results it was concluded that the efferent impulses originating from the cerebellar nuclei can produce contraction of a particular muscle through activation of the red nucleus. These impulses are, at the same time, transmitted to a small group of neurons in the VL and then forwarded to the neurons in the motor cortex. (8) The functional significance of the VL projection system has been discussed in relation to the efferent zones within the motor cortex. </td>

   <td style="text-align:left;"> NA </td>
   <td style="text-align:left;"> The representation of sound frequency (and of the cochlear partition) within primary auditory cortex has been investigated with use of microelectrode-mapping techniques in a series of 25 anesthetized cats. Among the results were the following: 1) Within vertical penetrations into AI, best frequency and remarkably constant for successively studied neurons across the active middle and deep cortical layers. 2) There is an orderly representation of frequency (and of represented cochlear place) within AI. Frequency is rerepresented across the mediolateral dimension of the field. On an axis perpendicular to this plane of rerepresentation, best-frequency (represented cochlear place) changes as a simple function of cortical location. 3) Any given frequency band (or sector of the cochlear partition) is represented across a belt of cortex of nearly constant width that runs on a nearly straight axis across AI. 4) There is a disproportionately large cortical surface representation of the highest-frequency octaves (basal cochlea) within AI. 5) The primary and secondary field locations were somewhat variable, when referenced to cortical surface landmarks. 6) Data from long penetrations passing down the rostral bank of the posterior ectosylvian sulcus were consistent with the existence of a vertical unit of organization in AI, akin to cortical columns described in primary visual and somatosensory cortex. 7) Responses to tonal stimuli were encountered in fields dorsocaudal, caudal, ventral, and rostral to AI. There is an orderly representation of the cochlea within the field rostal to AI, with a reversal in best frequencies across its border with AI. 8) Physiological definitions of AI boundaries are consistent with their cytoarchitectonic definition. Some of the implications of these findings are discussed. </td>
