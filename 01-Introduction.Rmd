# Introduction


Previous conceptual work developed a useful model of the structure of clinical development. The model is best described as an information maximization process [@kimmelman2015structure]. The term "intervention ensemble" [@kimmelman2015structure] refers to the idea that at the heart of the clinical development process are not the bare properties of an investigational product as such but rather our scientific understanding how the highly complex set of properties can be used to achieve something that benefits patients (information gain). This shift from the chemical properties of a molecule to the use of the molecule introduces an instructive *product*-*process* distinction. In medicine, the investigational product simply does not matter *qua* chemical structure. Ultimately, only the *process* of how to unlock and to use the therapeutic potential of a prodcut matters in clinical development [@kimmelman2015structure].
